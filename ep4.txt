Nurse: Please! I'll give it to you. This is a solved moment in time. I can't die here!
Think Spoiler: I can't fit through the door, you insensitive bitch!
Nurse: Well all thanks to my childhood friends, that is. He broke my (LEPRECHAUN CIRCUIT). But I can fix it!
Think Spoiler: Is the space machine a (SPOILERIZER)?
Nurse: It could be if you want.
Flower: No! We won't give it to you!
Nurse: She doesn't know what she-
Flower: [slaps The Nurse] We are not letting them win!
Think Spoiler: Be a lot cooler if you did.
Nurse: Flower does not represent me.
Flower: Shut up! I will not allo-
Nurse: Silence.
Spoiler: THE MALE WILL STEP FORWARD.
{The Nurse Steps forward.}
Flower: STOP!
Nurse: Flower this if for our own safety.
Flower: If our safety means the death of a race then I don't want to be safe.
Nurse: Then you will die stupid.
Spoiler: THE MALE IS CORRECT.
Flower: But NURSE!
Spoiler: WAIT. THE MALE IS THE ONE KNOWN AS THE NURSE?
Spoiler: THE NURSE IS THE ENEMY OF |SPOILERS|.
Flower: You didn't tell me you knew these things!
Nurse: I don't though! They're from my future!
Spoiler: SHALL WE |ELIMINATE| THE NURSE ONCE AND FOR ALL?
Think Spoiler: NOT YET. WE REQUIRE THEM TO CREATE BAD MILK.
Nurse: Bring me my space machine. You have a device for that, correct?
Think Spoiler: I CAN TELEPORT STUFF USING THE POWER OF BAD MILK! OBSERVE!
Nurse: I am.
{The (RATIS), still looking like an Army Recruitment Box is beamed into the room using bad milk.}
Nurse: Oh. I forgot it still looked like that... But there it is. My space machine.
Think Spoiler: ONE OF MY UNITS SHALL FOLLOW YOU INSIDE AND MAKE SURE YOU CAN'T FLY AWAY IN IT.
Nurse: Why would I.
Flower: He can't fly it anyways.
Nurse: I (may) have lied to you.
Flower: YOU SON OF A BITCH!
{A Spoiler follows The Nurse into the (RATIS) and it defabricates.}

::INSIDE THE (RATIS)::
Nurse: Yeah yeah. It's a slightly larger interior fit into a slightly smaller interior.
Spoiler: WHERE IS THE BAD MILK (SPOILERIZER)?
Nurse: Well, we have to find it.
Spoiler: DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF TIME IT WILL TAKE TO RETRIEVE THE DEVICE?
Nurse: No, although... do you know what time it is?
Spoiler: WHAT?
Nurse: KIDNAP!
Spoiler: |ELIMINATE|!
Nurse: {switches on a weapon suppression field} Your weapons are powerless!

::BACK OUTSIDE IN THE HOLDING CELL::
Think Spoiler: NURSE YOU PUMPKIN EATER!
Flower: Liar liar pumpkin eater!
{The (RATIS) refabricates.}
Nurse: {stepping out} I am not! {He holds up a Spoiler leg.}
Spoiler: |ELIMINATE|!
Nurse: {turns on the (RATIS)'s force field} I was originally going to let them get away with it, but then you made me change my mind.
Flower: Let's get out of here!
Nurse: Bye bye!
Think Spoiler: HAHA, DUMMY! {aims gun at Flower} SHE WILL BE |ELIMINATED| IF YOU DO ANYTHING.
Flower: Help me!
Nurse: I don't know how! You're outside of the force field. I can't help you. I'm safe though!
Heavy Artillery Spoiler: [blasts the force field, destroying it] FIELD |ELIMINATED|!
Nurse: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!
Think Spoiler: TROLOLOLOLOLOLOL.
{We cut to the future. The (RATIS) is locked away and The Nurse and Flower are back in the call.}
Flower: Welllll....
Nurse: Yup.
Think Spoiler: CLICKITY CLOIERLERIZER! BUILD THE DAMN SPOILERIZER!
Nurse: Well, Flower, I was going to refuse and not let them win, but seeing that torture is back on the table... HELP ME BUILD THE DAMN THING!
Flower: NO!
{Alexa boots up.}
Flower: Fine.
{Alexa powers down.}
Nurse: Just start by connecting these wires here.
Flower: [sadly] Okay...
