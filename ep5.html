		<p><b>THINK SPOILER: </b>ALL HAIL THE SPOILERS! THE SPOILERS ARE SUPREME!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[to Flower]</i> Maybe they're right. I mean they did cripple my <i>RATIS</i>'s shields. <i>[to self]</i> Although mine's only a <i>TYPE 69</i>.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Let's just get this over with. I can't stand the fact that we're about to assist the Spoilers kill an entire race.</p>

		<h1>NURSE WHOM:</h1>
		<h1>THE END OF ALL GOOD MILK.</h1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I fear what happens when that Alexa turns on...</p>
		<p><b>SPOILER: </b>SCANNERS INDICATE THAT THE SPOILERIZER IS ALMOST AT MAXIMUM COMPLETION!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Unfotunately...</p>
		<p><b>THINK SPOILER: </b>AWWWWWW YEAH!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[rolls eyes]</i></p>
		<p><b>THINK SPOILER: </b><i>[bounces to theme music]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[to Flower]</i> Look, that bit scares me too.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>But there has to be some way out of this, right?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I don't think so.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Then think harder!</p>
		<p><b>THINK SPOILER: </b>BEGIN DANCE ROUTINE - "<i>END OF ALL GOOD MILK</i>."</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I never thought I would find myself in a situation as unescapable as this. It's done. <i>[steps away from the complete<i>SPOILERIZER</i>]</i></p>

		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[breathes in]</i></p>
		<p><b>SPOILER: </b>MACHINE IS ABOUT TO REACH MAXIMUM FUNCTIONALITY!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[exhales.]</i> According to the air density... local gravity... <i>[calculations are flying through the air around The Nurse]</i> Accounting for mass... divide by zero... multiply by half... AND SUBTRACT! ALL BAD MILK SPRIONS CAN'T FUNCTION WHEN THE SPOILERIZER IS ACTIVE!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[blushes]</i></p>
		<p><b>CAPTAIN JACK: </b>ORA! <i>[bursts out of the carton]</i></p>

		<p><b>NURSE: </b>We have Jack.</p>
		<p><b>THINK SPOILER: </b>I AM FAR BEYOND HIM.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[uses <i>SONIC HAMMER</i> on The <i>SPOILERIZER</i>]</i> I just have to reverse the polarity. You know what that means!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Then all milk becomes good!</p>
		<p><b>THINK SPOILER: </b>YOU FEMUR HAVING BASTARD MAN! I SHALL SHOW YOU TRUE PAIN!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>How can you if you can't consume bad milk?</p>
		<p><b>THINK SPOILER: </b>LIKE THIS! <code>|ELIMINATE|</code>! <i>[fires huge eldirdge blast]</i></p>

		<p><b>FLOWER, JACK, AND NURSE: </b>GO!</p>
		<p><b>ALEXA: </b>Not so fast!</p>
		<p><b><i>The eldridge blast follows the gang</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[uses the <i>SONIC HAMMER</i> to turn on the force field]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>The force field deflects the blaster into the <i>SPOILERIZER</i> causing it to explode.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>QUICK!</p>
		<p><b><i>They all enter the <i>RATIS</i>.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>THINK SPOILER: </b><i>[powers up and charges at The <i>RATIS</i>.]</i></p>

		<p><b><i>BOOM! Think Spoiler is caught in the blast of the exploding <i>SPOILERIZER</i>.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>CAPTAIN JACK: </b>We did it. We saved the world.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Now to drop you off somewhere random because I double-lied and can't actually fly this thing where I want.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>So you didn't lie to me?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>No.</p>
		<p><b>CAPTAIN JACK: </b>Sucks. Want some exposition?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Sure.</p>
		<p><b>CAPTAIN JACK: </b>I come from the future, where the Spoilers have conquered the universe after finding an infinite source of bad milk. I'm part of the last surviving non-Spoiler beings. I was sent back in time after drinking bad milk to stop their rise to power.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Understandable. Have a nice day. <i>[lands The <i>RATIS</i> and shoves Jack out, closing the doors behind him]</i> So I suppose you want to go home.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Actually, I want to stay with you. You really need someone to keep you safe.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>You can come... but I don't <i>need</i> you.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Alright.</p>
		<p><b><i>The <i>RATIS</i> takes off</i></b></p>
