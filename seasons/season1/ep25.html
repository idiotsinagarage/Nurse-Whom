		<h3><i>-IN THE RATIS-</i></h3>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>You know, I need a day of break from all of this chaos. What do you say, Nurse?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I mean, I can try... but you know I have no idea how to land this thing.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Oh, whatever.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Look, I just took off in this thing and never looked back.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Did you take an instructional manual?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>No. They tell you what to do.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>What's wrong with that?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>No one tells me what to do. Now, if you could just hold your finger on that button there...</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Are we in space right now?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Possibly.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I could open the doors and we could get sucked out if you aren't sure.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Bruh.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Hold the button, Jack.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>..</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[places finger upon button]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Aight.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>What's this button do?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>So Flower, what were you thinking about when you meant break?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>I don't know. Maybe, like, a party.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Okay... Well I do have a 1999 button. Every <i>RATIS</i> has one.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Fuck kind of button?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well your car has a go button. My <i>RATIS</i> has a 1999 button. What's so wrong with that?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Cars have gas pedals, actually.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Have you ever been to 1999?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>When? I've never heard of that year...</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>You idiot.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>No, I'm Nurse.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>What've I gotten myself into.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>The <i>RATIS</i>. Can't you read?</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>It says "Army Recruitment Inside."</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>That’s big-brain for <i>RATIS</i>.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Suuuuuuuure....</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>You're just dumb.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[blushes]</i> No, he's not.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Let's just get to 1999.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>HELL YEAH! <i>[slams head on button]</i></p>

		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Shit, dawg. My head.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>I thought it was funny.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Same.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>[opens RATIS doors]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>You know the temporal ruler who invented the 1999 button was dreaming when he made it. Imma explain it, but tell me it if goes astray, but they woke up that morning. They could've sworn it was judgement day. The sky was purple, there were people running everywhere.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>THAT'S JUST THE LYRICS TO 1999!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well, where did you think Prince got 'em? His brain? HELL NO.</p>
		<p><b><i>All around them is times square.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Cool. What's the time?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Kidnap?</p>

		<p><b><i>Times square loses power and goes dark.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Wot?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>I don’t remember this.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Yeah, what the hell?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What? Did this not happen? Your planet's lame.</p>
		<p><b><i>A humongous glowing green object flies into the New Year's ball. The ball shatters.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[eats popcorn]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Where did you get that.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>My powers of summoning comical items at convenient times is on of my Temporal Ruler abilities.</p>
		<p><b><i>The shards from the ball cut everyone around them.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Cool. It sounds like someone paid extra for the sound system.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>This is real.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What's the difference?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Wait...</p>
		<p><b><i>The glowing green thing zooms off into the distance.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Everyone! In the <i>RATIS</i>! <i>[enters]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>Everyone else enters with him.</i></b></p>

		<p><b><i>The RATIS begins to sin out of control.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>JACK! THE BLUE BUTTON!</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[hits the blue button]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>The RATIS spins out of control.</i></b></p>

		<p><b>NURSE: </b>You bet your sorry ass it is! <i>[flies the RATIS towards the green thing]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>As they approach, they see the giant green thing is a glowing moth. It zooms around. The RATIS stays in pursuit.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Was there a piloting test for these things back on your home world?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yup.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Did you pass it?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Pass what?</p>

		<p><b><i>The moth lands on a building, causing the Earth to shake.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Ha ha, losers. You aren't in the sky!</p>
		<p><b><i>The interior of the RATIS rumbles.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I stand corrected.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>You can't even pilot this thing.</p>
		<p><b><i>All the civilians fall into sinkholes caused by the moth's landing.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well, you see, I can fly it when I can't hit anything.</p>
