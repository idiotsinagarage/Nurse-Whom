		<p><b><i>The Nurse looks very panicked.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Alright...</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Are we actually doing this?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>I guess so.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Now, where is this security of yours?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b><i>[calls security on wrist thing]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>People with guns show up.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Excellent.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>They have guns.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>So?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>But, they're guns.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>...So...?</p>
		<p><b>RED SHIRT: </b>What's wrong with guns?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah, what's wrong?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>They're evil.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Not if they're pointed away from us.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Very true! Kidnap! <i>[gets ready to go]</i></p>
		<p><b>CANON FODDER: </b>Follow us to the lift.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Okay that's cool.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Huh?</p>

		<h3><i>-IN THE LIFT-</i></h3>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Oh boy, here we go... <i>[nervous laughter]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Shut up, Robert.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Yeah, shut up Robert.</p>
		<p><b>RED SHIRT: </b><i>[loads gun and aims it all around]</i> Stay on guard.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What's going on?</p>
		<p><b>RED SHIRT: </b>The Sildrum are all over the place. You never know where they mig-</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>LOOK OUT!</p>
		<p><b>RED SHIRT: </b><i>[turns and sees something crawling around on the wall]</i></p>
		<p><b>WILDRUM: </b>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>SHOOT IT!</p>
		<p><b>RED SHIRT: </b><i>[pew]</i></p>
		<p><b>WILDRUM: </b><i>[jumps away revealing a hole in the elevator wall]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>Hundreds of Wildrum rush out of the hole, completely covering the walls and ceiling of the lift.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>ohno.</p>
		<p><b><i>A strange blue gas sprays from the hole.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>SLEEEEP GASSSS!!!!!!!1!!!</p>
		<p><b>RED SHIRT: </b><i>[falls to the ground and falls asleep]</i></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>[covers mouth and nose]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[holds breath]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[covers face]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>The Wildrum completely cover Red Shirt.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>NO!</p>
		<p><b><i>The Wildrum get off of him.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Look away. This is nasty.</p>
		<p><b>RED SHIRT: </b><i>[waking up]</i> mmmmph.... MMMMMMMMMMMM <i>[writhes in pain, face welded shut]</i></p>
		<p><b>CANON FODDER: </b>NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! <i>[opens fire on the Wildrum]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>No, no yet!</p>
		<p><b><i>Several Wildrum die. On top of the lift, Wildrum gnaw on the cables. The lift shakes.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Okay, if you couldn't figure this out, it's bad.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[uses the <i>SONIC HAMMER</i> to scan the elevator]</i> I can't stabilize us.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[hugs Robert]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Hold on, everyone, shut up. I'm focusing.</p>
		<p><b>CANON FODDER: </b>GOING DOWN!</p>
		<p><b><i>The lift begins to fall.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Nonononononononooooo....</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>SHUT UP!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I'M FOCUSING! <i>[imagines self in <i>RATIS</i>]</i></p>
		<br>
		<h3><i>-IN NURSE'S MENTAL RATIS-</i></h3>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Now, how do I survive... Let's slow it down.</p>
		<p><b><i>On the <i>RATIS</i> monitor, it shows the lift falling and it goes into slow mo.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Good. Now what's under us? <i>[using keyboard]</i> Calculating material due to resonance... PLAY AUDIO!</p>
		<p><b><i>The monitor plays a screeching noise made by the elevator rubbing against the shaft.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Calculating... METAL ALLOY! <i>[looks at monitor]</i> Doesn't crumple well. Can't rely on it to catch us. <i>[pulls out mega calculator]</i> Now if I just figure out which exact angle the elevator is falling at... <i>[calculations whiz by]</i> We all need to shift to the left!</p>
		<br>
		<h3><i>-ON THE ELEVATOR-</i></h3>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[snapping back to reality]</i> Oh, there goes gravity!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Did you just fall asleep while we were falling to our deaths?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>EVERYONE TO THE LEFT!</p>
		<p><b><i>Everyone goes to the left, to the left.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>WILDRUM: </b><i>[also to the left, to the left]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>That's what I was hoping for. </p>
		<p><b><i>The elevator leans onto it's side even more and the screeching gets louder as the elevator makes more contact with the shaft. The falling starts to slow down.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Its working!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>SHUT UP!!!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>KKKKIIIIIIIIIDDNAAAAAAAPPPP!!!!</p>
		<p><b><i>The lift hits the ground and the Wildrum fall on everyone.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>We aren't dead!</p>
		<p><b>WILDRUM: </b><i>[crawl towards everyone's faces]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Anyone injured?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Panicking, but unharmed.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Good. Now how do we get out of this one?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[tries to whack them off]</i></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>[begins prying the lift door open]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Okay, now this isn't good either.</p>
		<p><b>CANON FODDER: </b><i>[swatting Wildrum away]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>This could be the end of us! That is, if it weren't for me being here! <i>[<i>SONIC HAMMER</i>s the Wildrum]</i> I'm trying out my new Resonance Frequency App.</p>
		<p><b><i>The hammer makes a painfully loud and awful noise.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>WILDRUM: </b><i>[fall off]</i> REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>How did that work?! FIRST TRY!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>[still attempting to open the lift]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Robert, stand back. <i>[runs and charges at the door]</i> Time to kidnap your lockedness! <i>[breaks it down]</i></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>You could've used your hammer...</p>
		<p><b>NURSER: </b>It's out of power. That thing I did drained it. <i>[looks around]</i> There it is!</p>
		<p><b><i>The <i>RATIS</i> is glowing with power.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Everyone in there!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>It's the <i>RATIS</i>!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>We did it! We-</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>QUICKLY! DASH!</p>
		<p><b><i>Something falls from the ceiling.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[dashes to the <i>RATIS</i> with everyone close behind]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>Everyone gets into the <i>RATIS</i></i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[to Canon Fodder]</i> I know. You just got kidnapped. Now I may not be able to fly this thing to the upper level, but I can use a button to raise our elevation. <i>[presses]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>The <i>RATIS</i> flies upwards but almost immediately a crab claw smashes it down.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>No! No one else dies! TURBO!</p>
		<p><b>WILDRUM PRIME: </b><i>[hisses]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>The whole <i>RATIS</i> shakes as it struggles upwards.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Come on, you old boy.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Please...</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>EVERYONE HOLD ON!</p>
		<p><b>WILDRUM PRIME: </b><i>[tail glows]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I have to save them!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>[holds on tight]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>HYA! <i>[pulls lever]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>Everyone is teleported outside of the <i>RATIS</i> and in front of the Wildrum Prime.}</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>FInally, we meet. So you're the one who's been killing all of these fine people. I don't like it when something like you does that.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Here we go again...</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>OH YES!</p>
		<p><b>CANON FODDER: </b>Permission to open fire?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Not yet. Let's give it a chance to leave, then open fire. You hear that?! You are not welcome here. Now...</p>
		<p><b>WILDRUM PRIME: </b><i>[growls and circles]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're upset. But guess who is, too. ... Why, that would be m-FIRE!</p>
		<p><b>CANON FODDER: </b><i>[fires]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>How does it feel to lose?</p>
		<p><b><i>THe bullets ricochet at Canon Fodder.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>oh.</i></p>
		<p><b>CANON FODDER: </b><i>[falls]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Okay, this is bad again. BACK TO THE <i>RATIS</i>! <i>[gets in again]</i></p>
		<p><b>WILDRUM PRIME: </b><i>[eats Canon Fodder]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[gets in]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I can't save him... Wait, where's Robert?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>[tries to get in but is grabbed by Wildrum Prime]</i></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Well, this could be better.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>ROBERT! <i>[goes after him]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Nurse!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Shut up! Press the green button under the dial! Grab everyone else! Don't worry about me!</p>
		<p><b>WILDRUM PRIME: </b><i>[picks up Nurse]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I'll be fine <i>[laughs]</i> Hello, Beautiful!</p>
		<p><b>WILDRUM PRIME: </b><i>[all eyes turn to Nurse]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah, all I want is your extra time! <i>[to Robert]</i> I have everything under control!</p>
		<p><b>WILDRUM PRIME: </b><i>[beats Nurse into the ground]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[aching]</i> ...starting now...</p>
		<p><b>WILDRUM PRIME: </b><i>[opens mouth and holds Nurse over it]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>...starting in 5 minutes... Robert, do you have any ideas?</p>

		<p><b>WILDRUM PRIME: </b><i>[chokes and drops them both]</i></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Where the hell did that chair come from?!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I'll tell you when you're older. Now, we panic. When I told Flower, "Everything was going to be fine," I was lying. I lied. I have no way out.</p>
