		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Correct. But first... <i>[over speaker]</i> Why do you need this electricity?</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b><i>[surrounds time square in glowing powder]</i> It is necessary. The livestock in my country has been all but wiped out by an awakening in the Shadowed Places from Within.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Before I super-Murderball-Death-Kill you, I just wanted to know why. But that was lame. Extrapolate the Super-Murderball-Death-Kills!</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>You are too late. These extra terrestrials will be out new source of nourishment.</p>
		<p><b><i>A cocoon forms around Times Square.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Not after you are Super-Murderball-Death-Killed!</p>
		<p><b><i>The Torpedoes fire and blow up stuff. The cocoon carries Times Square into space.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>That ain't good. My torpedoes failed.</p>
