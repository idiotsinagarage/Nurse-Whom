::IN THE SPOILER PRISON CELL::
Think Spoiler: ALL HAIL THE SPOILERS! THE SPOILERS ARE SUPREME!
Nurse: [to Flower] Maybe they're right. I mean they did cripple my (RATIS)'s shields. [to self] Although mine's only a (TYPE 69).
Flower: Let's just get this over with. I can't stand the fact that we're about to assist the Spoilers kill an entire race.

--{EPISODE FIVE: THE END OF ALL GOOD MILK.}--

Nurse: I fear what happens when that Alexa turns on...
Spoiler: SCANNERS INDICATE THAT THE (SPOILERIZER) IS ALMOST AT MAXIMUM COMPLETION!
Flower: Unfortunately...
Think Spoiler: AWWWWWW YEAH!
Nurse: [rolls eyes]
Think Spoiler: [bounces to theme music]
Nurse: [to Flower] Look, that bit scares me too.
Flower: But there has to be some way out of this, right?
Nurse: I don't think so.
Flower: Then think harder!
Think Spoiler: BEGIN DANCE ROUTINE - "(END OF ALL GOOD MILK)."
Nurse: I never thought I would find myself in a situation as inescapable as this. It's done. [steps away from the complete (SPOILERIZER)]
Flower: [begins to cry]
Spoilers: ALL HAIL THE SPOILERS!
Think Spoiler: YES. WE ARE VERY COOL!
{The (SPOILERIZER) powers up.}
Nurse: Today I am no longer "The Nurse."
Flower: This is all your fault.
Nurse: [breathes in]
Spoiler: MACHINE IS ABOUT TO REACH MAXIMUM FUNCTIONALITY!
Nurse: [exhales.] According to the air density... local gravity... [calculations are flying through the air around The Nurse] Accounting for mass... divide by zero... multiply by half... AND SUBTRACT! ALL BAD MILK SPRIONS CAN'T FUNCTION WHEN THE SPOILERIZER IS ACTIVE!
Flower: [blushes]
Captain Jack: ORA! [bursts out of the carton]
Flower: YES!!!!
Nurse: Maybe there is always a way out!
Captain Jack: I'll hold off the Spoilers. You guys shut off the (SPOILERIZER)!
Nurse: We're locked up!
Captain Jack: TAKE THIS! [teleports a (SONIC HAMMER) into The Nurse's hand]
Nurse: KIDNAP! [The Nurse uses the hammer, which emits a buzzing noise, to magically unlock the cuffs chaining them to the wall.]
Flower: You did it Jack!
Think Spoiler: PROTECT THE (SPOILERIZER)!
Nurse: [bonks Spoilers on the head]
Flower: [watches the fight go down]
Nurse: FLOWER! DEACTIVATE THE MACHINE!
Captain Jack: ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!
Spoilers: IMPOSSIBLE! ALL CALCULATIONS RESULTED IN SUCCESS!
Nurse: Check your math!
FLower: [runs to the (SPOILERIZER)] I've got it!
Nurse: GOOD!
Think Spoiler: OH HELL NO!
Spoiler: |ELIMINATE|! [aims at Flower]
Nurse: NOOOO!!
Flower: [freezes up out of fear]
Think Spoiler: |ELIMINATED|! [fires laser]
Captain Jack: ORA! [punches the laser at the last Spoiler]
Flower: Thank you! [deactivates (SPOILERIZER)]
Think Spoiler: NO! MY HOMIES!
Nurse: You go! RUN! Run and never make milk bad again! I am The Nurse!
Spoilers: [make a tactical retreat]
Think Spoiler: I SHALL DEFEAT THEM MYSELF.
Nurse: You don't take my warning?
Think Spoiler: MY POWER IS FAR BEYOND YOU! I HAVE MASTERED THE ABILITIES THAT BAD MILK GRANTS.
Nurse: We have Jack.
Think Spoiler: I AM FAR BEYOND HIM.
Nurse: [uses (SONIC HAMMER) on The (SPOILERIZER)] I just have to reverse the polarity. You know what that means!
Flower: Then all milk becomes good!
Think Spoiler: YOU FEMUR HAVING BASTARD MAN! I SHALL SHOW YOU TRUE PAIN!
Nurse: How can you if you can't consume bad milk?
Think Spoiler: LIKE THIS! |ELIMINATE|! [fires huge eldridge blast]
Captain Jack: Noooo.
Alexa: Entering torture mode.
Nurse: Everyone in The (RATIS)!
Flower, Jack, and Nurse: GO!
Alexa: Not so fast!
{The eldridge blast follows the gang}
Nurse: [uses the (SONIC HAMMER) to turn on the force field]
{The force field deflects the blaster into the (SPOILERIZER) causing it to explode.}
Nurse: QUICK!
{They all enter the (RATIS).}
Think Spoiler: [powers up and charges at The (RATIS).]
Nurse: And NOW! [defabricates The (RATIS).] That should do it.
Think Spoiler: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!
{BOOM! Think Spoiler is caught in the blast of the exploding (SPOILERIZER).}
Captain Jack: We did it. We saved the world.
Nurse: Now to drop you off somewhere random because I double-lied and can't actually fly this thing where I want.
Flower: So you didn't lie to me?
Nurse: No.
Captain Jack: Sucks. Want some exposition?
Nurse: Sure.
Captain Jack: I come from the future, where the Spoilers have conquered the universe after finding an infinite source of bad milk. I'm part of the last surviving non-Spoiler beings. I was sent back in time after drinking bad milk to stop their rise to power.
NUrse: Understandable. Have a nice day. [lands The (RATIS) and shoves Jack out, closing the doors behind him] So I suppose you want to go home.
Flower: Actually, I want to stay with you. You really need someone to keep you safe.
Nurse: You can come... but I don't (need) you.
Flower: Alright.
{The (RATIS) takes off}

::BACK ON THE WOODEN PLANET::
Think Spoiler: [emerges from the explosion] I LIVED BITCHES [dances]
