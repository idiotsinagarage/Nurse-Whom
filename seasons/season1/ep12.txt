::IN THE LOUNGE OF A SPACESHIP::
{The Nurse looks very panicked.}
Nurse: Alright...
Flower: Are we actually doing this?
Robert: I guess so.
Nurse: Now, where is this security of yours?
Curtis: [calls security on wrist thing]
{People with guns show up.}
Nurse: Excellent.
Flower: They have guns.
Nurse: So?
Flower: But, they're guns.
Nurse: ...So...?
Red Shirt: What's wrong with guns?
Nurse: Yeah, what's wrong?
Flower: They're evil.
Robert: Not if they're pointed away from us.
Nurse: Very true! Kidnap! [gets ready to go]
Canon Fodder: Follow us to the lift.
Nurse: Okay that's cool.
Flower: Huh?
Canon FOdder: [leads them to the elevator]
{They all get in and the elevator starts to go down.}

--{EPISODE TWELVE: THE DESCENT}--

::IN THE LIFT::
Robert: Oh boy, here we go... [nervous laughter]
Nurse: Shut up, Robert.
Flower: Yeah, shut up Robert.
Red Shirt: [loads gun and aims it all around] Stay on guard.
Nurse: What's going on?
Red Shirt: The Sildrum are all over the place. You never know where they mig-
Nurse: LOOK OUT!
Red Shirt: [turns and sees something crawling around on the wall]
Wildrum: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Nurse: SHOOT IT!
Red Shirt: [pew]
Wildrum: [jumps away revealing a hole in the elevator wall]
{Hundreds of Wildrum rush out of the hole, completely covering the walls and ceiling of the lift.}
Nurse: ohno.
{A strange blue gas sprays from the hole.}
Nurse: SLEEEEP GASSSS!!!!!!!1!!!
Red Shirt: [falls to the ground and falls asleep]
Robert: [covers mouth and nose]
Nurse: [holds breath]
Flower: [covers face]
{The Wildrum completely cover Red Shirt.}
Nurse: NO!
{The Wildrum get off of him.}
Nurse: Look away. This is nasty.
Red Shirt: [waking up] mmmmph.... MMMMMMMMMMMM [writhes in pain, face welded shut]
Canon Fodder: NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! [opens fire on the Wildrum]
Nurse: No, no yet!
{Several Wildrum die. On top of the lift, Wildrum gnaw on the cables. The lift shakes.}
Nurse: Okay, if you couldn't figure this out, it's bad.
Nurse: [uses the (SONIC HAMMER) to scan the elevator] I can't stabilize us.
Flower: [hugs Robert]
Nurse: Hold on, everyone, shut up. I'm focusing.
Canon Fodder: GOING DOWN!
{The lift begins to fall.}
Nurse: Nonononononononooooo....
Flower: SHUT UP!
Nurse: I'M FOCUSING! [imagines self in (RATIS)]

::IN NURSE'S MENTAL RATIS::
Nurse: Now, how do I survive... Let's slow it down.
{On the (RATIS) monitor, it shows the lift falling and it goes into slow mo.}
Nurse: Good. Now what's under us? [using keyboard] Calculating material due to resonance... PLAY AUDIO!
{The monitor plays a screeching noise made by the elevator rubbing against the shaft.}
Nurse: Calculating... METAL ALLOY! [looks at monitor] Doesn't crumple well. Can't rely on it to catch us. [pulls out mega calculator] Now if I just figure out which exact angle the elevator is falling at... [calculations whiz by] We all need to shift to the left!

::ON THE ELEVATOR::
Nurse: [snapping back to reality] Oh, there goes gravity!
Robert: Did you just fall asleep while we were falling to our deaths?
Nurse: EVERYONE TO THE LEFT!
{Everyone goes to the left, to the left.}
Wildrum: [also to the left, to the left]
Nurse: That's what I was hoping for. 
{The elevator leans onto it's side even more and the screeching gets louder as the elevator makes more contact with the shaft. The falling starts to slow down.}
Flower: Its working!
Robert: AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
Flower: SHUT UP!!!
Nurse: KKKKIIIIIIIIIDDNAAAAAAAPPPP!!!!
{The lift hits the ground and the Wildrum fall on everyone.}
Nurse: We aren't dead!
Wildrum: [crawl towards everyone's faces]
Nurse: Anyone injured?
Robert: Panicking, but unharmed.
Nurse: Good. Now how do we get out of this one?
Flower: [tries to whack them off]
Robert: [begins prying the lift door open]
Nurse: Okay, now this isn't good either.
Canon Fodder: [swatting Wildrum away]
Nurse: This could be the end of us! That is, if it weren't for me being here! [(SONIC HAMMER)s the Wildrum] I'm trying out my new Resonance Frequency App.
{The hammer makes a painfully loud and awful noise.}
Wildrum: [fall off] REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Nurse: How did that work?! FIRST TRY!
Robert: [still attempting to open the lift]
Nurse: Robert, stand back. [runs and charges at the door] Time to kidnap your lockedness! [breaks it down]
Robert: You could've used your hammer...
Nurser: It's out of power. That thing I did drained it. [looks around] There it is!
{The (RATIS) is glowing with power.}
Nurse: Everyone in there!
Flower: It's the (RATIS)!
Robert: We did it! We-
Nurse: QUICKLY! DASH!
{Something falls from the ceiling.}
Nurse: [dashes to the (RATIS) with everyone close behind]
{Everyone gets into the (RATIS)}
Nurse: [to Canon Fodder] I know. You just got kidnapped. Now I may not be able to fly this thing to the upper level, but I can use a button to raise our elevation. [presses]
{The (RATIS) flies upwards but almost immediately a crab claw smashes it down.}
Nurse: No! No one else dies! TURBO!
Wildrum Prime: [hisses]
{The whole (RATIS) shakes as it struggles upwards.}
Nurse: Come on, you old boy.
Flower: Please...
Nurse: EVERYONE HOLD ON!
Wildrum Prime: [tail glows]
Nurse: I have to save them!
Robert: [holds on tight]
Nurse: HYA! [pulls lever]
{Everyone is teleported outside of the (RATIS) and in front of the Wildrum Prime.}'
Nurse: FInally, we meet. So you're the one who's been killing all of these fine people. I don't like it when something like you does that.
Flower: Here we go again...
Nurse: OH YES!
Canon Fodder: Permission to open fire?
Nurse: Not yet. Let's give it a chance to leave, then open fire. You hear that?! You are not welcome here. Now...
Wildrum Prime: [growls and circles]
Nurse: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're upset. But guess who is, too. ... Why, that would be m-FIRE!
Canon Fodder: [fires]
Nurse: How does it feel to lose?
{THe bullets ricochet at Canon Fodder.}
Nurse: (oh.)
Canon Fodder: [falls]
Nurse: Okay, this is bad again. BACK TO THE (RATIS)! [gets in again]
Wildrum Prime: [eats Canon Fodder]
Flower: [gets in]
Nurse: I can't save him... Wait, where's Robert?
Robert: [tries to get in but is grabbed by Wildrum Prime]
Robert: Well, this could be better.
Nurse: ROBERT! [goes after him]
Flower: Nurse!
NursE: Shut up! Press the green button under the dial! Grab everyone else! Don't worry about me!
Wildrum Prime: [picks up Nurse]
Nurse: I'll be fine [laughs] Hello, Beautiful!
Wildrum Prime: [all eyes turn to Nurse]
Nurse: Yeah, all I want is your extra time! [to Robert] I have everything under control!
Wildrum Prime: [beats Nurse into the ground]
Nurse: [aching] ...starting now...
Wildrum Prime: [opens mouth and holds Nurse over it]
Nurse: ...starting in 5 minutes... Robert, do you have any ideas?

::IN THE RATIS::
Flower: [presses the green button]
{The (RATIS) materializes on the main deck.}
Flower: [opening doors and looks at everyone] Come with me!
Curtis: Aight.

::BACK WITH THE WILDRUM PRIME::
Nurse: Hear that noise? That? That is my (RATIS) removing everyone from this ship.
Wildrum Prime: [shuts mouth]
Nurse: Put. Me. Down. -Oh and Robert, too, please.
Wildrum Prime: [reopens mouth and attempts to put both Nurse and Robert in]
Nurse: Oh.
Robert: Oh, crap.
Nurse: [to Prime] Well, you won't see this coming! [throws a chair into its mouth, choking it]
Wildrum Prime: [chokes and drops them both]
Robert: Where the hell did that chair come from?!
Nurse: I'll tell you when you're older. Now, we panic. When I told Flower, "Everything was going to be fine," I was lying. I lied. I have no way out.
Robert: Fantastic.
Nurse: Kidnap!
Wildrum Prime: [swallos chair and roars in anger]

::BACK WITH THE RATIS::
Flower: Is that everyone?
Everyone: Yes.
Flower: There has to be a fast return switch, right? [finds a convenient button labeled "quick return"] Oh, shut up! [presses it]

::IN THE PRIME'S NEST::
{The (RATIS) fabricates.}
Nurse: OH! FLOWER YOU ARE A GENIUS!
Robert: YES! [runs towards the (RATIS)]
Nurse: [also runs]
Wildrum Prime: [teleports Robert and Nurse back 5 feet]
Nurse: Shit.
Robert: We need to distract her.
Nurse: Robert, pull down your pants.
Robert: Nevermind.
Nurse: Really? Well then what do you suggest?
Flower: [opening RATIS door] DUCK! [throws giant bomb] I found a whole stash of explosives!
Nurse: [to self] Fuck. [to Flower] THROW THEM ALL!
Flower: [throws another 5 explosives]
Nurse: That work?
Robert: [runs towards RATIS at an incridibly high speed]
Nurse: [dashes] WE GOT IN! [closes doors] Flower, move I have to get us out of here!
Flower: K.
Wildrum Prime: [looks at bombs confused]
{The bombs explode!}
Nurse: [flies the RATIS outta there.] I'll drop you off somewhere nice. (And by that I mean somewhere random.)
Flower: Yup.
Robert: Yup, indeed.
Nurse: I can't wait to find out what happens next!
