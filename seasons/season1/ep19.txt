{The tree hits the ground.}
Nurse: Is everyone okay?
Robert: [gets up] I'm doing just great [violent coughing]
Nurse: Flower, did you hit your head?
Flower: No..?
Nurse: Fuck.
Lit: [swings flail]
Nurse: Who wants to see if they can catch that, because I am not losing my hand.
Flower: No one.
Nurse: ah.
Robert: [grabs Nurse and drags him out of the way] Let's just go.
Nurse: Robert, put me down! What are you doing?!
Flower: He's being a good person.
Nurse: Is that sass?
Flower: Well you des-
Nurse: SHUT! CHRISTMAS ON MARS, YOU FUCKING PARTY POOPER NOW CAN WE GET A MOVE IN!
Flower: Whatever. I give up-
Nurse: SHUT. Christmas on Mars.
Lit: [swings flail again]
Will: [dodges and falls down hill]
Nurse: That way! [points] Well, get up.
Blaze: [grabs Will and runs off]

Lit: [forces her back with the flail]
Nurse: Eh, you can always get new ones.

Flower: What are you doing?!
Nurse: You want me gone, right?
Flower: True.
Nurse: Choose fast. The fires coming.
Charlotte: [sighs] I'll come back for you, Will. [runs]
Nurse: Let. The boy. Go! I will blow myself up. Not such a hunt, huh? Let him go and you can hunt me and hang me on your wall. But remember this: you can't hang up a blown-up corpse. I think...
Lit: hmmmmmm....
Nurse: Choose now. The fire is right there. I'm going to run. Three. Two. ...
Lit: [presses more buttons]
Nurse: NO! That's fucking cheating!
{Sprinklers come out of the trees and put out the fire.}
Nurse: Okay. Well I will still blow myself up if you don't let the kid go.
Lit: How will you blow yourself up.
Nurse: My hammer. It has a "(BOOM)" setting.
Lit: Get all your companions to meet at the oasis. That's where the child is. [jumps into the trees and swings away]
Nurse: So, it's on, then. Me first.
