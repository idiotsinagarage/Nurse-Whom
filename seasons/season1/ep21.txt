::AT THE OASIS::
Robert: [to Flower] Oh wow, that took forever.
Nurse: What did?
Robert: GAH! JESUS!
Nurse: Robert!
Flower: Fucking hell.
Charlotte: [to Matchstick] Let them go!
Nurse: He's good.
Matchstick: Yeah.
Nurse: So how many are left?
Furnace: [appearing] Two.
Lit: [also appearing, knocks Matchstick to the ground with flail] 
Nurse: Hey! he was only trying to help the helpless.
Flower: I guess so.
Lit: The helpless are our game! None shall interfere with the hunt.
Nurse: Then you are stupid.
Furnace: [presses button]
Nurse: NOPE! [sonics control panel]
Furnace: You are too late. The trap is activated.
Nurse: Okay. well, I tried. Anyone get any ideas? Okay, no? Well then we're screwed. Or are we? Wait, why am I the only one talking?
Robert: Yes.
Nurse: ..
Robert: OUCH! [is cut by something invisible]
Nurse: BLADES! I can't stop them!

--{EPISODE TWENTY-ONE: THE OASIS}--

{The blades slice Nurse, Flower, and Will}
Nurse: OUCH!
Flower: SHIT!
Nurse: Language.
Will: Gah.
Flower: How are we going to get out of this
Nurse: Idk lomfa
Charlotte: NO! [picks up will and is cut]
Nurse: DON'T MOVE!
Robert: Why?
Nurse: They're everywhere. Time to fly! (By the way, does anyone know how to fly?)
Robert: No.
Will: No.
Charlotte: No.
Flower: No.
Matchstick: No.
Nurse: Well, us (TEMPORAL RULER)s can, but only has long as gravity allows it.
Flower: THAT'S JUMPING!
Nurse: Sounds lame when you say it that way. Well then, wait oh no! I have disease!
Matchstick: Only Fire Battlers can see and hear them. I'll t-try to deactivate them.
Nurse: [fake coughs] I think I caught cancer!
Will: Just stop.
Nurse: No actually. Like I think I have a transmittable cancer. Everyone stay back! [starts to glow]
NFurnace: Why don't I make it easier. Discs, go for Matchstick.
Nurse: I'M FUCKING GLOWING! IS THIS NOT FRIGHTENING?!
Matchstick: [is cut by several blades]
Nurse: I caught cancer and now I'M FUCKING GLOWING! Is anyone going to look at me?
Matchstick: [is trying to hack the blades, but collapses]
Nurse: NO! I may have caner, but I still have a heart. Well, three to be exact. Now will someone get this cancer the fuck out of me?!
Blades: |SELF DESTRUCT ACTIVATED|.
Nurse: Oh no.
Furnace: Oh shi- [violently explodes]
Flower: Are we going to be safe?
Nurse: It's Christmas on Mars and I caught cancer and started glowing! I don't know anymore!
Lit: [swings flail at Matchstick]
Nurse: EXTRAPOLATE THE FANS!
{The fans extrapolate, sucking Lit into a pit vent.}
Nurse: I don't have cancer, by the way!
Robert: We did it.
Nurse: Not yet. I wanted everyone to ignore me. By being blatant in trying to get attention, no one payed attention to what I was actually doing, letting me hack all of the fans. But yeah, we are surrounded by non-spinning blades.
Flower: Which stopped us from getting sucked up!
Nurse: Correct. YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THAT MEANS YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!
Flower: IT'S CHRISTMAS! ON MARS!
{Lit has been dead for quite some time now.}
Matchstick: Okay teh, why don't I take you back to your ship.
Nurse: Are you serious? An epic moment is happening. Whatever. Let's GO!
Matchstick: F-follow me...
{They begin towards the RATIS.}
Nurse: Cool.
Charlotte: How about instead of Mars, you actually take me to my house.
Nurse: Well that would require me to figure out how to fly my ship. So how about NO.

::AT THE RATIS::
Will: Bye bye, burning guy!
Nurse: Thanks for Christmas!
Matchstick: Uh, you're welcome.
Nurse: This is my ship! I bet I could use the "FAST RETURN" feature to go back to the last spot.
{They all enter, leaving Matchstick behind.}
Nurse: This is the first time I'll be de-kidnapping someone. WHO WANTS TO GO HOME?!
Will: Me.
Charlotte: Same.
Nurse: TWO HOMES COMING RIGHT UP!
{The RATIS defabricates.}
