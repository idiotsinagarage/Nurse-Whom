		<p><b><i>Electricity shoot out of all the civilians eyes and goes into the moth's mouth.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>You, are you killing them?</p>
		<p><b>MOTH: </b><i>[jumps off building and flies past a bunch of buildings]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>The windows of the buildings shatter. Civilians are cut by glass shards.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>NURSE! IT'S COMING RIGHT AT US.</p>

		<h1>NURSE WHOM:</h1>
		<h1>LAMP</h1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Now I need to figure out what this thing is. What did I see.... <i>[does big brain stuff]</i> Due to the glowing compound... <i>[calculations whiz]</i> ...max altitude it flew...</p>
		<p><b>MOTH: </b><i>[gaining]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[counts on fingers]</i> ...number of eyes... type of saliva... How did it smell-? Sulfur! I got it! It's an alien moth!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>...</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>NO SHIT.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>It isn't shit. It's an alien moth.</p>
		<p><b>MOTH: </b><i>[roars]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>See? ALien.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>So how does that help?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Now we know it isn't an Earth moth. Big brain!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>But how does that <i>help</i>?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I didn't think of that.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Oh, great!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>You got any other ideas?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>You're the alien expert.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>That's like saying that just because I am a time traveling alien on your planet means I'm an alien expert.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Oh no.</p>
		<p><b><i>An electricity barrier blocks the exit to time square.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>This ain't good.</p>
		<p><b>MOTH: </b><i>[flies upwards]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>the ground cracks.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>ohshit.</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>ohshit.</i></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>ohshit.</i></p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>ohshit.</i></p>
		<p><b>RATIS: </b><i>[silently]</i> <i>ohshit.</i></p>
		<p><b>MOTH: </b><i>[blows up Brooklyn bridge with lightning from antennas]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh no. A bridge no one cares about!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Bruh.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I am, in no way, your brother.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>That bridge is well known.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Whatever. After it!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>If you are going to steer the <i>RATIS</i> again, I'm going to fucking murder you.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Then consider me dead. <i>[gets in the RATIS]</i></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>[gets in]</i> Oh, so the plan's "crash into buildings until it goes away?"</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Perhap. Jack are you coming?</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Yup. <i>[gets in]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Aight. Let's get him up in the air! <i>[pulls lever]</i></p>
		<p><b>RATIS: </b><i>[sins]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[presses blue button]</i></p>
		<p><b>RATIS: </b><i>[spins]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>There we go. Oh, and let's do this <i>[bonks wheel with hammer]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>What was that?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Stabilization.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>WHY DIDN'T YOU USE THAT EARLIER?!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Deadass hungry. Anyone else want something to eat?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Just fly.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Okay.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Could go for a <i>boneless pizza</i> ngl.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Tell me how the fuck pizza can be boneless?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>If it don't got bone in it, it's boneless.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Dickhead.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>There it is. Now that we found it, what do we do?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Why would I know?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Robert, got any ideas?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Uh, lamp?</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Now you're just saying things.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Wait! Robert! That's it! We attract it to the <i>RATIS</i>'s top lamp. <i>[presses buttons]</i> We just gotta make the lamp on the top of the exterior super bright!</p>
		<p><b><i>The lamp is unreasonably bright.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>We're inside and my eyes still hurt.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Correct.</p>
		<p><b>MOTH: </b><i>[flies to RATIS]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Now what?</p>
		<p><b>MOTH: </b>What is this thing?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>It speaks. Robert, what do we do?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Speak back.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[over speakers]</i> Who the fuck are you?</p>
		<p><b>MOTH: </b>Who are you?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I'm the Nurse. Now tell me who you are.</p>
		<p><b>MOTH: </b>I go by Lunimor. I am here on an important mission. I recommend staying out of the way.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Getting in the way is my thing. Why are you here. I just wanted to go to 1999.</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>I was sent to this planet to replenish our electricity.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>By who? Or should I say whom?</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>By the council of Byorg.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Fuck-org?</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>The leaders of my planet.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well, they're lame.</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>I have no time for you, aliens. I must complete my mission.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I won't let you.</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>Then you shall die.</p>
		<p><b>NURSEL: </b>Don't think so.</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b><i>[backs up and then starts agressively flapping his wingers at the RATIS, causing huge gusts of wind to blow at it]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>Three buildings are thrown at the RATIS by the wind.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>No no no no no. I don't take bad milk from you. <i>[raises shields]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>What is going on.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Wind.</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b><i>[blows more debris at the RATIS]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Frick.</p>
