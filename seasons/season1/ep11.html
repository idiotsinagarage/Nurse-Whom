		<h3><i>-ON A SPACESHIP-</i></h3>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>My <i>RATIS</i> is gone!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>How are we going to get out of here?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Why is that vent so big?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>This ship is very warm.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Why?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>What if we never leave?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I don't know.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b><i>[opens door]</i> The escape pods are on the bottom floor of the ship, but we can't really go there.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>We're not using escape pods until I get back my <i>RATIS</i>.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Whatever floats your boat.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>So what was in that vent? The Prime?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Yep.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Does the Prime move around a lot?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>She stays guarding the escape pods.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Where's the main infestation?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>They've spread all over the place.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Flower, Robert, we may be here a while. Curtis <i>[proceeds down hall]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Come along!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[follows]</i></p>

		<p><b><i>A man with a sheet covering his head is being rushed to a room.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>How many casualties?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>40-er... 41.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>How long have they been here?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>2 weeks.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>So what have you done to stop them?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>We called an exterminator and tried to stay awake.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh good! Where's the exterminator?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Well, his head is in the vents. Dunno where the rest is.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[winces]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>That's awful.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b> h u h.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b><i>[opens door into lounge]</i> We're prepared now, I think... <i>[enters]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Ah... I see.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b><i>[opens two minifridges full of soda and surns on a coffee machine]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Of course.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b><i>[turns on speakers and blasts death metal at full volume]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Oh god, that's loud.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Has to be. It's better to deaf than dead.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Why?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>You don't know what Wildrum do?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Nope.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>They wait 'til someone falls asleep, then weld their eyes, nose, and mouth shit, causing them to suffocate.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah, just about.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Nurse, we need to leave right now!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Not sure if we can.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What's your name Captain?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Captain Curtis, on duty.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Where do you come from, Curtis?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Mars Colony 76.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Ah, so you speak Martian.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>I've taken a few classes.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What are you speaking right now?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Martian. Sorry, if I've mispronounced a few things.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Cool.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Wait...</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>But he's speaking English.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>No, he's not. My <i>RATIS</i> has Google translate installed.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Okay, then?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>The fact that it's translating means it's still alive. Nevermind personal stuff. What are we going to do? If we get my <i>RATIS</i> back, we can get everyone off this ship. But the Prime has it...</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>We can send you down with some security.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Think that'll work?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Fifth time's the charm...?</p>
