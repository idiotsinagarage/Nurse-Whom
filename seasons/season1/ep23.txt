::OUTSIDE IN PUERTO RICO::
Andrew: That was fast. [takes out gun]
Nurse: Kill it!
{Andrew fires his gun. The Chupacabra jumps out of  =the way and starts dashing away.}
Jack: Get dat muthafucka!
Nurse: Yeah! Try not to mistake it for my leg. I very much value it.
{Andrew chases the Chupacabra.}
Nurse: DASH! [dashes]
{The Chupacabra dashes away from civilization.}
Andrew: Now I can finally find its lair.

--{EPISODE TWENTY-THREE: THE HUNT FOR THE CHUPACABRA}--

{The Nurse dashes even faster. The Chupacabra runs into a cave.}
Nurse: GET IT!
{Everyone enters the cave.}
Andrew: [reloads gun] It’s the end for you, demon.
Chupacabra: [snarls]
Nurse: Fuckin shoot it. SHOOT IT!
{A metal door closes off the exit to the cave.}
Nurse: Shit.
Andrew: Unfortunately, I can't shoot it. This gun's fake. [crushes gun]
Nurse: Bruh. I finally used the word bruh.
Andrew: [laughs mechanically]
Nurse: What the fuck about this is funny?
{Andrew begins to contort}
Nurse: Uh... Flower? 
Flower: [farther back] What did you say?
Nurse: Flower, get out of here!
Andrew: You're so much dumber than we thought.
Flower: What did you say?
Nurse: Holy shit man what did you eat? I have irritable bowls, too. No shame in that.
Flower: What did you say?
Nurse: FLOWER RUN!
Flower: What's going on?
Nurse: Robert? Where are you? And you, Jack?
{They are literally right behind him.}
Robert: Right here.
Jack: Same.
Nurse: Am I the only one seeing this?
Robert: Nope.
Nurse: Really? Spiderman looking bitch. Crab?
Jack: What the hell is that?
Nurse: See? Now what are you, you sexy thing?
{Laser cages form around Nurse, Jack, and Robert.}
Nurse: You had to fucking do that? Like why? Actually why?
Andrew: I am a bounty hunter here to take your hammer to my master.
Nurse: Again? Dude is it possible to scare you guys off?
Andrew: Nope.
Chupacabra: Their devotion is quite admirable.
Nurse: Devotion to wha- wait did you just speak perfect English?
Chupacabra: To me.
Nurse: (You) want it? The fucking Chupacabra wants my hammer.
Chupacabra: I go by Cadmus.
Nurse: Oh. Never heard of you.
Cadmus: Do you wish to be elucidated?
Nurse: I'm sorry, I don't do fancy words. Well I do "extrapolate."
Cadmus: So you are just as lacking in the mental capacity as they say...
Nurse: Perhap-
Camdus: Give me the device without a fuss and your death will be, perhaps, less (excruciating).
Nurse: Naw. You tried this before and it ain’t gunna work.
Robert: Why do you need his hammer?
Nurse: Was I supposed to ask that?
Cadmus: For you see, hundreds of years ago a disturbance in the astral plane occurred. I don't know what caused it but a Pheonix from Origos flew through it.
Nurse: Was that in 1560?
Cadmus: Correct.
Flower: [catches up] 1560?
Nurse: That was Christmas on Mars! I ate that bird.
Cadmus: The interesting thing about these phenomena is that they can be manipulated with enough sonic energy.
Nurse: Ah. How about no. That's what I thought!
Cadmus: The even more intriguing aspect of these disturbances is that powerful enough of them could deactivate every (RATIS) in the universe. Your race would never time travel again.
Nurse: Well mine's a type 69, so... I also think the Temporal Rulers would stop you.
Cadmus: It works silently. The Temporal Rulers would never notice until they stepped inside their (RATIS)es.
Nurse: Yeah, but that's dumb so Imma stop you.
Cadmus: There is no statement as laughable as that.
Nurse: True.
Cadmus: No being deserves a power so great and destructive. So I shall put a stop to it.
Nurse: Except for me. I deserve a (RATIS).
Cadmus: Pfft. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!! (FUCK NO!)
Nurse: Like, Imma count to five. If you aren't gone Imma do something.
Cadmus: Give me the device, my dimwitted prisoner. This is your final chance.
Nurse: Five. Alright I counted to five. No one lets me do that. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU JUST GOT YOURSELF INTO?! I was taking it easy on you.
Cadmus: I do not fear you little man.
Nurse: You know what they say. Little man. Big.... Big brain.
Cadmus: In your case, that statement is false.
Nurse: [mockingly] In your case, (THAT) statement is false. Welcome to Hell you fucktard.
Andrew: [takes hammer]
Nurse: NOPE! I have seventeen more and each one taken gets deactivated.
Flower: That isn't true.
Nurse: FUCK YOU FLOWER I HAD A FUCKING PLAN YOU FUCKING IDIOT! WHY THE FUCK WERE YOU FUCKING BORN?!
Flower: Shut.
Nurse: Why?
Flower: Christmas on Earth.
Nurse: Dafuq?
Robert: HAH.
Jack: ???
Nurse: What? WHAT?! (WHAT?!?)
Cadmus: This cave is set to implode in 5 second. Farewell. [teleports away]
Andrew: [teleports away]
Nurse: They have my hammer! We've got to get it.
