::INSIDE THE (RATIS)::
{The (RATIS) fabricates on a planet.}
Nurse: So... I wonder where we are...
Flower: So you kidnap me and then go to a random place?!
Nurse: That's why it's fun!
Flower: But my dad will be worried sick about me!
Nurse: Don't worry! My space machine travels in time too.
Flower: Oh! So you can get me back right after we left!
Nurse: Theoretically...
Flower: Theoretically?!
Nurse: Do you happen to know how to fly this thing?
Flower: You mean you don't know how to fly it?
Nurse: Nope! [exits (RATIS)]
Flower: Where are you going? [follows]
{They step out on a different planet with rocks and ground all made out of wood.}
Nurse: That's odd.
Flower: Everything's wood!
Nurse: Precisely! Look at that animal over there!
{In front of them is a deer made out of wood.}
Nurse: It's as if a device made everything wooden!
Flower: But how?
Nurse: I have no idea!
Flower: I don't like this game place! Bring me back home!
Nurse: I've told you! I can't!
Flower: Then why did you take me here?!
Nurse: Because I'm lonely!
Flower: Now what do we do?
Nurse: I say we look for civilization. Maybe someone here will know how to pilot this thing...
Flower: Fine.
{They both travel into the forest with wooden leaves in front of them. They spend an hour traveling forward until they find themselves at the edge of a cliff.}
Nurse: Look!
Flower: I see it!
Nurse: Civilization! There's a city right down there!
Flower: But how do we get down there?
Nurse: I have no idea!
{We cut to a first person perspective of someone looking at a screen with a live video of Nurse and Flower on it.}
???????: [menacingly] INTRUDER ALERT! HUMANOIDS DETECTED!!! THEY WILL BE |ELIMINATED|!!
{We cut back to Flower and The Nurse.}
Nurse: I wonder what the people down there are like.
Flower: I don't care what they're like! I just want to go home.
Nurse: Why would you want to go home?
Flower: I was kidnapped by a mad man in a red box! What do you think?!
Nurse: Well that's rude!
{There is a robotic humming noise from behind The Nurse and Flower.}
Flower: What is that?
Nurse: Why should I know?
???????: [menacingly] YOU ARE AN INTRUDER. YOU WILL COME WITH ME!
Nurse: On who's order?
???????: ON THE ODER OF THE SPOILERS!
Flower: Nurse do we have to go with them?
Nurse: I don't think there are any other pleasant options.
Spoiler: CORRECT.
Nurse: Maybe they'll take us to the city!
Flower: Maybe the city isn't a city we want to be in.
Nurse: Yeah, I haven't considered that.
