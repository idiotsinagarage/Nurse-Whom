::IN THE RATIS::
Robert: So, do you still have no clue how to fly this thing?
Nurse: Wever will.
Flower: Actually?
Nurse: You will never be able to go home.
Robert: Actually what?
Nurse: Yep. So-
Flower: You idiot!
Nurse: That's my nam- I mean, no it isn't. It's "Nurse."
Flower: Okay, "Nurse."
{The (RATIS) lands.}
Robert: Okay, where'd we end up this time?
Nurse: That's the fun of this. DOORS! [opens doors] Looks like we're in a haunted house.
{They step out.}
Robert: Wait, [looking outside through a window] that's my old neighborhood.
Nurse: It is?
Robert: Yeah-SWEET JESUS!
{A clown mannequin falls out of a closet.}
Nurse: What?
Robert: Scared the hell out of me!
Nurse: Wha- onho. Not you. Anyone but you.
Robert: Who's this?
{Someone steps out of the shadows.}
Nurse: An old friend.
Flower: I know him.
Commander: Long time, no see.
Nurse: Commander...

--{EPISODE THIRTEEN: HAUNTED}--

Commander: Nurse...
Nurse: Why are you here? Also, can you fix what you did to my (RATIS)?
Commander: Yes... but I won't.
Nurse: YOU! [charges]
Commander: [aims (LASER HAMMER)] Not another step.
Nurse: You think that scares me?
Flower: Nurse, don't-
Commander: It should, peasant. [shoots ceiling, turning it into ash]
Nurse: Yeah, well I don't think you would.
Commander: Not yet, we need to have some fun first.
{The door is violently kicked open.}
Nurse: Who?
{Two young people enter.}
Charlotte: What the hell is all that noise?
Will: Wait for me!
Nurse: Oh no...
Flower: Who are they?
Nurse: Uh... I mean... I don't know. That's the problem. Commander?
Will: [to Robert] Oh, hi, not-dad.
Charlotte: [sees Robert] (Robert). It's (you).
Nurse: [to Robert] Uh oh...
Robert: H-hi, ,kids...
Nurse: Of course they're yours.
Robert: Yes and no.
Nurse: Why are they looking at you like that?
Commander: NOBODY CARES! TIME FOR SOME (ACTION)!
Nurse: Robert, why?
Clown Mannequin: [stands up]
Nurse: Robert, what did you do?
Clown Mannequin: [hand opens up to reveal a gun]
Nurse: GET BACK! Commander, what is your deal, man? Robert, why were they looking at you like that?
Robert: [gets back] I think we should focus on living.
Will: I have no idea what's happening.
NursE: What's your name, child? And you, too, girl.
Commander: [yawns and says to clown] Kill them before this turns into a soap opera.
Nurse: Kids! Get over here!
{The two of them run over to the Nurse.}
Nurse: Now, kids, run behind me. This is my mess to clean up. The Commander is my problem. Just get away from here. [to Commander] Now, if you want to get out of here without cuffs on, let them go. It's me you want.
Flower: [to Charlotte and Will] Come on, let's go!
Will: Okay. [they follow]
Commander: But killing all your little pets would be so much fun. I still control the Nest-In Consciousness. 
Nurse: What's your plan?
Commander: To trap everyone in this house with my minions. Do you know how much plastic is in this place? A helluva lot of it!
Nurse: Well... I won't let you do it.
Commander: Oh, you sweet summer child, I ALREADY HAVE!
Nurse: .               NO!
Commander: Yes. Run along, now. Toil with the other worms.
Nurse: But you said they were trapped.
Commander: Do you not listen? [sighs] The exits have Falligreyan forcefields around them.
Nurse: ROBERT! FLOWER!
Robert: Yes! We found the exit!
Flower: Wait...
Robert: For what?
Flower: No look!
Robert: What's that?
Flower: I don't know... Here. [picks up a spooky candle] Let's see... [touches spooky candle to weird glowing light from beyond the exit]
Robert: Oh no. We're trapped!
Charlotte: GODDAMNIT!
Clown Mannequin: [catches up]
Flower: Robert, protect your kids.
Robert: On it!
Charlotte: Pfffft! How ya gonna do that?! Cry alone in your room for 24 hours?
Robert: I-
Will: Actually, it was usually for a whole day.
Charlotte: Twe-nevermind.
Clown Mannequin: [aims gun hand]
Flower: Everyone, to the left!
{Everyone moves to the left, to the left.}

::BACK WITH NURSE AND COMMANDER::
Nurse: Let them go! They have nothing to do with you.
Commander: Doesn't matter.
{Some plastic skulls roll forth.}
Commander: Now run! Run like you always do.
Nurse: [runs and shouts back] I'm coming back for you!
Skulls: [roll with malice]
Nurse: [runs faster]
{A fake knife flies towards Nurse.}
Nurse: I have a feeling that knife is going to feel real. [ducks]
Skulls: [pick up even more speed]
Nurse: [swerves right]
{The skulls hit the wall and blow a giant dent into it. A Pumpkin Man jumps off the wall.}
Nurse: Well this got out of hand fast. I wonder how the others are doing.

::BACK WITH ROBERT AND FLOWER::
Robert: Okay, here we go.
Will: [gasp] I see it! [calculations whiz through his head] 30x2=J, 9+Z=7! I KNOW WHAT TO DO! [yeets spooky candle at clown]
Flower: Oh no.
{The clown is set on fire.}
Flower: BUT LOOK!
Will: What is it?
Flower: IT ISN'T STOPPING!
{The flaming clown mannequin trudges towards the gang.}
