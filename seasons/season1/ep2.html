        <h3>-INSIDE THE <i>RATIS</i>-</h3>
        <p><b><i>The </i>RATIS<i> fabricates on a planet.</i></b></p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>So... I wonder where we are...</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>So you kidnap me and then go to a random place?!</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>That's why it's fun!</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>But my dad will be worried sick about me!</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>Don't worry! My space machine travels in time too.</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>Oh! So you can get me back right after we left!</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>Theoretically...</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>Theoretically?!?</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>Do you happen to know how to fly this thing?</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>You mean you don't know how to fly it?</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>Nope! <i>[exits </i>RATIS<i>]</i></p>
        <p><b><i>They step out on a different planet with rocks and ground all made out of wood.</i></b></p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>That's odd.</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>Everything's wood!</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>Precisely! Look at that animal over there!</p>
        <p><b><i>In front of them is a deer made out of wood.</i></b></p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>It's as if a device made everything wooden!</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>But how?</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>I have no idea!</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>I don't like this game place! Bring me back home!</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>I've told you! I can't!</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>Then why did you take me here?!</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>Because I'm Lonely!</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>Now what do we do?</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>I say we look for civilization. Maybe someone here will know how to pilot this thing...</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>Fine.</p>
        <p><b><i>They both travel into the forest with wooden leaves in front of them. They spend an hour traveling forward until they find themselves at the edge of a cliff.</i></b></p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>Look!</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>I see it!</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>Civilization! There's a city right down there!</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>But how do we get down there?</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>I have no idea!</p>
        <p><b><i>We cut to a first person perspective of someone looking at a screen with a live video of Nurse and Flower on it.</i></b></p>
        <p><b>▌▌▌▌▌▌▌: </b><i>[menacingly]</i> INTRUDER ALERT! HUMANOIDS DETECTED!!! THEY WILL BE <code>|ELIMINATED|</code>!!</p>
        <p><b><i>We cut back to Flower and The Nurse.</i></b></p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>I wonder what the people down there are like.</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>I don't care what they're like! I just want to go home.</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>Why would you want to go home?</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>I was kidnapped by a mad man in a red box! What do you think?!</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>Well that's rude!</p>
        <p><b><i>There is a robotic humming noise from behind The Nurse and Flower.</i></b></p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>What is that?</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>Why should I know?</p>
        <p><b>▌▌▌▌▌▌▌: </b><i>[menacingly]</i> YOU ARE AN INTRUDER. YOU WILL COME WITH ME!</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>On who's order?</p>

        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>Nurse do we have to go with them?</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>I don't think there are any other pleasant options.</p>
        <p><b>SPOILER: </b>CORRECT.</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>Maybe they'll take us to the city!</p>
        <p><b>FLOWER: </b>Maybe the city isn't a city we want to be in.</p>
        <p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah, I haven't considered that.</p>
