::DEEP IN THE JUNGLE::
Robert: I think we lost them. What happened to the Nurse?
Charlotte: I think he's way back.

::WITH THE NURSE::
Nurse: So the game begins. Let's make it more interesting. [pulls out hammer] No (SONIC HAMMER). [pulls off cap on the bottom] Now, if you would kindly remove your weapons.
{Crickets.}
Nurse: Guess their hearing isn't as good as I thought.
{The ground under the Nurse starts to collapse.}
Nurse: This can't be good.
{The Nurse falls into the pit. A metal sheet begins to cover the pit.}
Nurse: Oh, I wonder what this thing does...
{The pit becomes fully covered.}
Nurse: Shit, I can't see anything. 

--{EPISODE TWENTY: THE NURSE'S GAMBLE}--

::MEANWHILE, AT THE OASIS::
Blaze: [places several metal discs around Will]
{The discs turn invisible.}
Blaze: The trap is set.
Lit: [arrives] Blaze, The (TEMPORAL RULER) is around the pit trap.
Blaze: Very well. Let's get going. Chop chop.
Will: This sucks.
Matchstick: Yeah...
Will: AAAAAHHH-
Matchstick: Shhhh. If they catch me helping you they'll kill me.

::IN THE PIT::
Nurse: So, I have to sit here and wait then. This isn't Christmas-y at all. Wait... what was that?

::AT THE OASIS::
Matchstick: [jumps over the discs and puts Will on shoulder] Do you know where your friends are?
Will: Not really.
Matchstick: Oh, fantastic. More Opportunity to get caught. [runs off, away from the oasis]

::DEEP IN THE JUNGLE::
Flower: Now that the Nurse isn't here, I would like to express how much I hate this. I hate this.
Blaze: [lands behind Flower and reveals flame trident]
Flower: Wait, you can't attack us. I heard the Nurse say he'll blow himself up if you kill us.
Blaze: [sighs] Indeed. [makes his way in the direction of the pit trap] To find the child, head towards the oasis.
Flower: Where is it?
Blaze: Northeast of here.
Flower: Thank you. Please kill the Nurse.
Blaze: Will do.
{Blaze makes his way to the pit trap, which isn't to far off.}
Blaze: [presses some buttons]
{A trident shaped hole appears in the trap.}
Blaze: [stabs at Nurse]
Nurse: Woah woah woah, WAIT! I've deactivated my hammer. Put down your weapons. Let's fight hand to hand.
Blaze: Your preference is noted. [stabs again]
Nurse: NOTED?!?
Blaze: [stabs at Nurse repeatedly]
{A prong lands in his shoulder.}
Nurse: OW! THAT'S IT! [puts powercore back in hammer] Try this! [turns off the glowing heat of Blaze's trident] Not so hot now?!
Blaze: Still stabs people.
Nurse: Oh yeah? [opens the pit with hammer] Now we see you!
Blaze: [hisses]
Nurse: Don't be so rude!
{The trident extends 3 feet}
Blaze: [stabs again]
Nurse: [dodges] Put it down! It makes you look weak!
Blaze: I am not weak!
Nurse: Then why must you use that?
Blaze: [hisses] I shall tear you apart with my bare hands! [stabs pit trap controls, stopping it from closing]
Nurse: Okay? Now we're talking. [pulls out comically large water pistol]
Nurse: GAME SET CHECKMATE! [sprays Blaze]
{The water evaporates.}
Nurse: Oh. But it was comically large!
Blaze: [drops trident and lunges at Nurse]
Nurse: Uh, this isn't good.
Matchstick: [drops in from above and punches Blaze to the ground] Ow ow my hand! I think I sprained something!
Nurse: Now this is Christmas!
Will: [with Matchstick] He, Nurse.
Nurse: Bill!!
Matchstick: I'm so sorry for putting you and your companions in danger.
Nurse: Hey it's all part of the fun. By the wat that bird was so good.
Matchstick: I-
Nurse: SHUT! CHRISTMASONMARS!
Blaze: [gets up]
Nurse: Oh, look! Baby is back up!
Blaze: Looks like the runt's getting friendly with the game.
Matchstick: Oh no. Uh.
Nurse: Yes he is. But you aren't gonna have time to question it [punches] FUCK! THAT'S BOILING HOT!
Matchstick: Um y-yeah this holiday is wrong we shouldn't k-kill people for n=nothing but-
Blaze: SHUT UP!
Nurse: MY FUCKING HAND HOLY FUCKING SHIT!
Will: I think we should get out of here.
Nurse: Yes, but you see my HAND FEELS LIKE IT'S ON FUCKING FIRE! Kids these days...
Matchstick: I have some hot coals to numb the pain.
Nurse: NO MORE FUCKING FIRE!
Matchstick: O-ok...
Nurse: Anyone have any ice?

::DEEP IN THE JUNGLE::
Charlotte: Goddamnit, where is that kid?
Robert: No clue.
Charlotte: RHETORICAL QUESTION, DIPSHIT!
Robert: Ok, jeez. [sigh] Look, you're worried, I get it, but we need to stay calm to find him.
Charlotte: How would you "get it." You didn't know his first name for three years!
Flower: [breathing heavily] I found you guys! Will is at the oasis!
Robert: Oh, neat.
Charlotte: Where?
Flower: It should be close by. Over that way.

::BACK WITH NURSE::
{The three of them are running from Blaze.}
Nurse: Alright, gang. We ready? This maneuver may just work. Three, two, one!
Will: I have disease!
Nurse: We have to stop running! Oh no!
Blaze: Time to die, runt!
Nurse: The kid has disease!
Matchstick: Y-yeah.
Will: [obviously fake coughing]
Nurse: Oh no, what if we get disease!
Matchstick: That'd be horrible.
Blaze: What is this?
Will: A very bad disease.
Nurse: NOW! [uses (SONIC HAMMER) to open another pit trap under Blaze] SUCKER! EXTRAPOLATE THE FANS! GRIND HIM!
{Giant vent fans in the pit trap wind up and suck Blaze in, grinding him into little Fire Battler chunks.}
Nurse: We have to find the others!
Matchstick: Holy crap, it worked!
Nurse: [calmly] Why wouldn't it have? [strolls along]
Will: Where are the others.
Nurse: I can only assume they went looking for you at... (THE OASIS)...
