::IN THE BOUNTY HUNTERS' TIME SHIP::
Flower: We'er going to die.
Drolis: Correct.

--{EPISODE NINE: GLOCKTOPUS}--

Robert: [scared Robert noises]
Nurse: EVERYONE GET BACK IN THE (RAITS)!
{The Nurse goes to enter but is blocked by Sheoherds Noy.}
Nurse: Well, there's always one more option. In the event of a horrible incident, the (RATIS) will land where it was last. For example: Opening the Airlock.
Drolis: [fires at the monologuing Nurse]
Nurse: [steps aside revealing Drolis shot the airlock control]
{The airlock blasts open sucking everyone into space.}
Flower: YOU IDIOT!
Nurse: I know!
Robert: What she said!
Nurse: Don't rub it in! Hold your breath!
{Everyone is sucked out of the airlock and is shot down to Earth from the upper atmosphere. The (RATIS) is floating and swerves over to where the Nurse is falling.}
Nurse: [falls in] Good boy! Now we have to get the others.
{The Nurse swoops the (RATIS) under Flower and Robert right before the emergency protocol zaps it back to its previous safe location.}
Flower: Now what?
Nurse: Well I don't know if they can survive a fall from the upper atmosphere. That orb guy might be able to save them.

::BACK WITH THE HUNTERS::
Syrix: [saves the other two]
Sheoherds Noy: Bruh.
Drolis: Time for Murder.
Sheoherds Noy: Nurse: cash me outside how bout dat.

::BACK ON EARTH::
Nurse: I feel like we haven't won yet.
{And then the bounty hunters fell from the sky.}
Nurse: NOOOOOO!!!!!
Drolis: As the old Earth saying goes, "IMMA BUST A CAP IN YO ASS!"
Nurse: Ohno.
Flower: Why?! LITERALLY WHY!??!
Nurse: Don't ask me. I'll tell you when you're older.
Drolis: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! [rapid gunfire]
Nurse: RUN! [runs]
Flower: [running] You say that like you had to decide to do that!
Nurse: He's too powerful!
Robert: [runs]
Nurse: How do we stop a rock octopus wielding eight glocks?
Flower: Broccoli.
Nurse: Really?
Flower: NO! WHY THE HELL WOULD I KNOW!
Nurse: I'll t-
Flower: SHUT UP!
Drolis: [shoots and runs faster]
Nurse: INTO THAT BUILDING!
Flower: Back into the gun store?!
Nurse: Yup. [goes into gun store and picks up 2 AK-47s]
Robert: [runs away]
Drolis: [barges in] HAHAHAHAHAHAA!
Nurse: [jumps out and fires AKs]
Drolis:  P a t h e t i c .
Nurse: I thought it would work, okay?
Drolis: Then you're stupid in the head.
Nurse: That, I may be.
Robert: Stop right there, Glocktopus!
Nurse: Robert?
Flower: Robert?
Drolis: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA YOU AINT GONNA DO SHIIIIITTT YOU AINT GONNA DO SHIIIITT YOU AINT GONNA D-
Robert: [shoots Drolis with a water pistol]
Drolis: [shrieks in agony]
Robert: [shoots with water pistol again]
Drolis: Stop! STAHP!! STAHP!!! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!
Flower: [confusion]
Nurse and Flower: How did you do that?
Robert: I'll tell you when you're older?
Nurse: B- But I'm 103!
Drolis: [aggressively cries]
Sheoherds Noy: Wut hav u done to my boi?
Nurse: Robert, any ideas about how to stop Sheoherds Noy?
Robert: Uh, nope.
Nurse: Seriously? Anything?
Robert: We could light him on fire?
Nurse: Yeah, I could agitate his molecules causing them to rapidly heat up with my (SONIC HAMMER)! It might just set him on fire! [uses (SONIC HAMMER)]
Sheoherds Noy: Ouch, my hecking ears!
Nurse: It isn't setting him on fire, but... [sets the (SONIC HAMMER) to max volume] This may do something!
Sheoherds Noy: OW MY PAIN, aaaaaaaaaah [is defeated]
Nurse: All that's left is Syrix, that orb thing. [uses the hammer at Syrix] DELETE SYSTEM 32! Now all you can do is make it rain here, right onto the glocktopus.
Syrix: Did you assume I'm a robot? Das racist.
Nurse: Is your shell not electricity?
Syrix: It ain't.
Nurse: This may be harder than I thought.
Flower: [grabs the biggest orb and squeezes it]
Syrix: Ow, what the fuck! [knocks Nurse away with wind]
Nurse: [isn't knocked over because Syrix is weakened]
Nurse: Now that you're all listening, know this: I am not kind to anyone. Think about what that says about what I will do to you. Go. I will spare you if you do. But turn back, look at this planet, and I will hunt you, like you hunted me, but worse. Worse than the torture of ten-thousand Spoilers. Worse than the noise of the never ending cymbals. Worse than you.
Sheoherds Noy: Initiate skedaddle!
Nurse: That's right! Run. Run like me and don't look back.
{And... they had already teleported away.}
Flower: You did it!
Nurse: I mean, you guys helped a little bit. Oh, what the hell. WE DID IT!
Robert: Yaaaaay.
