		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b><i>The Nurse dashes even faster. The Chupacabra runs into a cave.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>GET IT!</p>
		<p><b><i>Everyone enters the cave.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b><i>[reloads gun]</i> It’s the end for you, demon.</p>
		<p><b>CHUPACABRA: </b><i>[snarls]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Fuckin shoot it. SHOOT IT!</p>
		<p><b><i>A metal door closes off the exit to the cave.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Shit.</p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b>Unfortunately, I can't shoot it. This gun's fake. <i>[crushes gun]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Bruh. I finally used the word bruh.</p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b><i>[laughs mechanically]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What the fuck about this is funny?</p>
		<p><b><i>Andrew begins to contort</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Uh... Flower? </p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[farther back]</i> What did you say?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Flower, get out of here!</p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b>You're so much dumber than we thought.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>What did you say?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Holy shit man what did you eat? I have irritable bowls, too. No shame in that.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>What did you say?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>FLOWER RUN!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>What's going on?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Robert? Where are you? And you, Jack?</p>
		<p><b><i>They are literally right behind him.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Right here.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Same.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Am I the only one seeing this?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Nope.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Really? Spiderman looking bitch. Crab?</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>What the hell is that?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>See? Now what are you, you sexy thing?</p>
		<p><b><i>Laser cages form around Nurse, Jack, and Robert.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>You had to fucking do that? Like why? Actually why?</p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b>I am a bounty hunter here to take your hammer to my master.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Again? Dude is it possible to scare you guys off?</p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b>Nope.</p>
		<p><b>CHUPACABRA: </b>Their devotion is quite admirable.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Devotion to wha- wait did you just speak perfect English?</p>
		<p><b>CHUPACABRA: </b>To me.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>You</i> want it? The fucking Chupacabra wants my hammer.</p>
		<p><b>CHUPACABRA: </b>I go by Cadmus.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh. Never heard of you.</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>Do you wish to be elucidated?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I'm sorry, I don't do fancy words. Well I do "extrapolate."</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>So you are just as lacking in the mental capacity as they say...</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Perhap-</p>
		<p><b>CAMDUS: </b>Give me the device without a fuss and your death will be, perhaps, less <i>excruciating</i>.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Naw. You tried this before and it ain’t gunna work.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Why do you need his hammer?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Was I supposed to ask that?</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>For you see, hundreds of years ago a disturbance in the astral plane occurred. I don't know what caused it but a Pheonix from Origos flew through it.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Was that in 1560?</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>Correct.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[catches up]</i> 1560?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>That was Christmas on Mars! I ate that bird.</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>The interesting thing about these phenomena is that they can be manipulated with enough sonic energy.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Ah. How about no. That's what I thought!</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>The even more intriguing aspect of these disturbances is that powerful enough of them could deactivate every <i>RATIS</i> in the universe. Your race would never time travel again.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well mine's a type 69, so... I also think the Temporal Rulers would stop you.</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>It works silently. The Temporal Rulers would never notice until they stepped inside their <i>RATIS</i>es.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah, but that's dumb so Imma stop you.</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>There is no statement as laughable as that.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>True.</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>No being deserves a power so great and destructive. So I shall put a stop to it.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Except for me. I deserve a <i>RATIS</i>.</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>Pfft. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!! <i>FUCK NO!</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Like, Imma count to five. If you aren't gone Imma do something.</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>Give me the device, my dimwitted prisoner. This is your final chance.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Five. Alright I counted to five. No one lets me do that. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU JUST GOT YOURSELF INTO?! I was taking it easy on you.</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>I do not fear you little man.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>You know what they say. Little man. Big.... Big brain.</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>In your case, that statement is false.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[mockingly]</i> In your case, <i>THAT</i> statement is false. Welcome to Hell you fucktard.</p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b><i>[takes hammer]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>NOPE! I have seventeen more and each one taken gets deactivated.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>That isn't true.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>FUCK YOU FLOWER I HAD A FUCKING PLAN YOU FUCKING IDIOT! WHY THE FUCK WERE YOU FUCKING BORN?!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Shut.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Why?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Christmas on Earth.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Dafuq?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>HAH.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>???</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What? WHAT?! <i>WHAT?!?</i></p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>This cave is set to implode in 5 second. Farewell. <i>[teleports away]</i></p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b><i>[teleports away]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>They have my hammer! We've got to get it.</p>
