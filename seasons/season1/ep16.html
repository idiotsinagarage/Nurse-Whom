		<p><b><i>The decoration sparks and falls over.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>You did it, Robert.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Toss it back or I'll kidnap your whole family. Wait, I already did that.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>[tosses back hammer]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>These are some big glorified action figures. <i>[catches hammer]</i> Last time I saw them, they were small, but now they're person sized.</p>
		<p><b><i>The Nurse has a vision of Captain Jack</i></b></p>
		<p><b>CAPTAIN JACK: </b><i>[in the vision]</i> I can't even tell you what I'm thinking right now <i>[fades away]</i></p>
		<p><b>PUMPKIN MAN: </b><i>[emerges and begins to give chase followed by ghosts]</i></p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>Uh... <i>[fumbles with clown arm]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>The clown arm fires, shooting a ghost decoration.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>GREAT JOB, KIDDO!</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b><i>[guns down all of the ghosts]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Robert, what did you do to these kids to make 'em like this?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Literally nothing.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Can you two shut? If I had known you would talk so much I wouldn't've kidnapped you!</p>
		<p><b>PUMPKIN MAN: </b><i>[shoots clown arm out of Charlotte's hands]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>DASH!</p>
		<p><b><i>And then they all limp dashed away.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>We need to find the <i>RATIS</i>.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>But the last one was fake!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah. Well I asked this before but we were interrupted. WHY THE HELL ARE YOU KIDS HERE!?!</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>Oh yeah, I rented this place for a haunted house thing. Turns out it was an alien ship.</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>I guess that's just how it be sometimes.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh, that's strange.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Ow. Ow. Are we -ow- almost there?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I don't know we're just aimlessly dashing.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Can we dash aimfully, please? I'd prefer to keep my blood.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh, yeah. Sorry. Well, we need to look through every door. On of them might be where the Commander is hiding. Like this one! <i>[opens a door to reveal a room full of clowns, ghosts, and action figures]</i> Shit.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Language.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Shut up. <i>[closes door]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>How about this one! <i>[opens a door to reveal a portapotty]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Ah. We've found it. In here. That...thing. <i>[opens the door]</i></p>
		<p><b>COMMANDER: </b><i>[inside the door]</i> Sorry, Nurse...</p>
		<p><b><i>The inside of the portapotty is his <i>TYPE 98 RATIS</i>.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>COMMANDER: </b><i>[takes out laser hammer]</i> OCCUPIED.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Is that a sonic hammer?!</p>
		<p><b>COMMANDER: </b>WHAT THE FUCK IS A SONIC!?!??!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Okay..?</p>
		<p><b>COMMANDER: </b><i>[aims laser hammer]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Wait. Why would you want to kill me? We're friends. <i>[winks at everyone else]</i></p>
		<p><b>COMMANDER: </b>So, you'd rather me kill the humans?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well, when you put it that way...</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Don't you dare.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Kidding! If you're going to shoot anyone... <i>[yoinks laser hammer]</i> SHOOT YOUR LEPRECHAUN CIRCUIT! <i>[shoots part of the main console.]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>The entire haunted house disappears, leaving just the portapotty.</i></b></p>
		<p><b><i>From the laser hammer, a plastic arm stretches out and grab the Nurse's neck.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[choking]</i> How does it do that?!</p>
		<p><b>COMMANDER: </b>I have the Nest-In Consciousness in that hammer.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh, well at least I was able to karma you first.</p>
		<p><b><i>The arm beings to really strangle the Nurse.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Ghu-</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[grabs the <i>SONIC HAMMER</i> from Nurse's hand.]</i> Nurse I got you! <i>[bonks the arm]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[pulls the injured arm off neck]</i> THANKS!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>No problem.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[yeets arm and hammer across the now empty field.]</i></p>
		<p><b>COMMANDER: </b>NO!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yes.</p>
		<p><b><i>The Nest-In Consciousness falls out of the compartment in the hammer. All the decorations and action figures start going crazy and shooting everywhere.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NEST-IN CONSCIOUSNESS: </b><i>[roars]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>There's the <i>RATIS</i>! <i>[spots it not to far off in the distance]</i> QUICK! KIDNAP!</p>
		<p><b><i>The <i>RATIS</i> doors open on their own.</i></b></p>
