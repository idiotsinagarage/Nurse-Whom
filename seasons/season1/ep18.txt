--{EPISODE EIGHTEEN: THE EVIL FOREST}--

::BACK IN THE JUNGLE::
Nurse: I really shouldn't have taken this, but it tastes SO good! Seriously, is no one going to try it?
Flower: You IDIOT!
Nurse: More for me!
Charlotte: Actually, can I?
Nurse: Sure! Have a leg! [rips off a leg and gives it to Charlotte]
Charlotte: [takes leg] So how are we gonna do this?
Robert: Split up?
Nurse: Well, see, since it's Christmas on Mars, we should stick together.
Flower: We're splitting up.
Nurse: HEY!
Robert: Apart or together we should run.
Nurse: Great deduction! But we should run together during Christmas on Mars.

::WITH THE FIRE BATTLERS::
{They just started into the forest.}
Lit: You're not far... I can tell. [sniff] Ahahahahaha...

::WITH THE GANG::
Nurse: Do you think you can smell this bird?
Flower: Leave the bird! You're gonna get us killed!
Nurse: We're going to get killed either way. With or without the bird.
Flower: But our odd-
Nurse: SHUT! Christmas on Mars.
Flower: You still think this is Christmas?
Nurse: Lots of dashing, so yeah. Yeah I do.
Robert: But instead of halls, we're dashing through the jungle, oh wait. WE'RE NOT! [runs off]
Nurse: Oh we have been standing still for quite so time now. We really need to get going.
Flower: DU-
Nurse: Shut. Christmas on fucking Mars. Let me have some fun.
Flower: [sighs and dashes]
Will: [dashes]
Charlotte: [dashes whilst shoving Phoenix lag into mouth]
Nurse: Kids, go with your father.
Charlotte: Uncle, but whatever. [goes with Robert]
Nurse: You still don't appreciate him, even after what he did to save you?
Will: WAIT UP! [follows Robert]
Nurse: [catching up with Flower] Kids these days.
Flower: You're worse than them.
Nurse: SHUT!
Flower: [dashes before Nurse can say Christmas on Mars one more time]
Nurse: [whimpers] christmas on mars.
Furnace: [emerging from trees] It's called (UMDRERR).
Nurse: They're here. I really should have run with everyone else.
Furnace: [pulls out fire spear]
Nurse: Good thing i have a shield! [holds up Phoenix defensively] See?
Furnace: [hisses]
Nurse: That not making you happy? Have some then. It is (HEAVENLY)!
Furnace: [yoinks Phoenix]
Nurse: Yeah, now take a bite!
Furnace: [leaps forward trying to take a bite out of Nurse's head]
Nurse: [ducks] NOT OF ME! [to self] Well there goes my shield. [dashes]
Furnace: [dashes after him]
Nurse: TARZAN! [tries to swing from vines]
Furnace: [throws spear at vines, cutting them]
Nurse: WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAA- [lands] Well, that was a strange expeRIENCE ON MY GOD WHAT THE HELL!??!??!
{The spear launches itself at Nurse's arm.}
Nurse: FUUUUUCK!! [dodges left]
{The spear flings around and returns to Furnace's hand.}
Nurse: Cool. I mean, AAAAAAAHHHH!!!! [dashes into foliage]
Furnace: [throws spear which begins to home in on Nurse]
{The Nurse dodges and falls through a wall of bushes and trees landing right in front of the rest of the gang.}
Nurse: [at the spear] I'm gone loser! [to the gang] Oh, there you guys are.
Flower: Damn it.
Nurse: Not happy to see me, I see. So, fine. I'll admit I knew this bit was coming. I just wanted to play along.
Flower: You IDIOT! [slaps him]
Robert: [facepalms]
Nurse: You got a problem with this? I thought you wanted to come with me because of the running.
Flower: You fucking kidnapped everyone fucking one of us.
Nurse: (right).
Flower: I will beat the shit out of you. 
Nurse: Shut up.
{The spear shoots through the bushes towards Nurse.}
Nurse: You can beat me up tomorrow. NOT TODAY, THOUGH! [dodges] It's Christmas! -on mars-.
Flower: SHUT UP!
{The spear hits a tree next to Nurse, melting it.}
Furnace: Gotcha.
Nurse: How does one melt a tree? I mean, a material like wood do-
Robert: Just stop talking.
Nurse: But clearly wood can't d-
Furnace: [charges at Nurse]
Nurse: point taken.
{Everyone runs.}
Charlotte: Even though I might die, at least that bird was damn good.
Nurse: Finally, someone agrees!
{Loud hissing is heard in the distance.}
Nurse: THIS WAY! [swerves right]
Flower: When we get out of this-
Nurse: (IF).
Flower: (IF) we get out of this, I will beat your ass.
Nurse: Looking forward to seeing you try.

::WITH FURNACE::
Lit: [lands behind Furnace] Where'd they go?
Furnace: Lost their scent.
Lit: No matter [presses some buttons]

::WITH THE GANG::
{The tress around Nurse and the gang shoot 3 small daggers.}
Will: [gets grazed by the dagger on the arm] Ouch!
Nurse: Where'd that come from?
Robert: The trees.

::WITH THE BATTLERS
Lit: [smells Will's blood] Found 'em.

::WITH THE GANG::
Nurse: THE BLOOD! Will, get over here!
Will: Ok, ow. [goes to Nurse]

::WITH THE BATTLERS::
Lit: [dashes towards the smell very quickly]

::WITH THE GANG::
Nurse: Over here. [picks up stick]
Will: [winces as Nurse does something]

::FIRE BATTLERS::
Lit: I'M COMING FOR YOU!
{As he arrives, he finds a stick with blood on it.}
Furnace: [arrives] They're in the trees.
Nurse: [from a tree]  YO MOTHERFUCKERS! [uses (SONIC HAMMER) to light the tree on fire] Let's burn this forest down!
Flower: Wait, how will we get out?
Nurse: Oh shit. [tries to put out the fire but fails] Well this isn't good.
