		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>How will you follow them if you can't fly it?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I can fly it! <i>Landing's</i> the issue.</p>
		<p><b><i>They arrive on the rooftop with the <i>RATIS</i>, shield deactivated. The gang stops to breathe for a second.</i></b></p>

		<p><b><font color="green">SHEOHERDS NOY: </font></b>How are you contacting meh?</p>
		<p><b><i>On the <i>RATIS</i>, Robert is having a midlife crisis in the corner.</i></b></p>

		<p><b><font color="green">SHEOHERDS NOY: </font></b>Answer my question.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I stuck an iPhone 5 in your goop. See?</p>

		<p><b><font color="blue">SYRIX: </font></b>I gotchu, fam.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>Ah</i>. That's not good. Luckily I'm in a <i>RATIS</i>.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>It's only <i>TYPE 69</i>.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>DON'T TELL THEM! Oh, Robert, when did you get here?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Bruh.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I don't know what that means.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Bruh.</p>
		<p><b><i>A <i>SUPER MURDER BALL DEATH KILL</i> is launched at the <i>RATIS</i>.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>This might be risky, but I'm going to try to land on their ship.</p>

		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Crashing it is, then!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>NO!</p>

		<p><b><font color="green">SHEOHERDS NOY: </font></b>Stupid <i>TEMPORAL RULER</i> bullshit. Teleport them on board so we can kill him here.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[from the call]</i> Oh do shut up. By the way, you can't end the facetime audio. Facetime never dies.</p>
		<p><b><font color="blue">SYRIX: </font></b><i>[teleports the <i>RAITS</i> on board]</i> </p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Wait, how did you do that? Oh. No I know. I have a <i>TYPE 69</i>.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Seriously, why didn't you steal a <i>TYPE 98</i>?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>A gut feeling. <i>[stepping out]</i> Now, where is my hammer?!!!!</p>
		<p><b><i>In front of The Nurse, the hammer sits in a comically large mousetrap next to Drolis.</i></b></p>
		<p><b><font color="brown">DROLIS: </font></b>Go ahead... Take it.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well when you put it that way... <i>[pulls out a mousetrap suppressor from comically large pocket]</i> I'll help myself.</p>
		<p><b><i>The Nurse walks over and grabs the hammer and the trap doesn't go off.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Luckily I came prepared. You know, I'm going to say the <i>D-WORD</i>... DASH! Dash as far away from here as you can go! I don't care who your employer is. You can leave. You should leave. I'm saying a lot.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Yeah, you need to shut up.</p>
