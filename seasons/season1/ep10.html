		<h3><i>-ON A SPACESHIP-</i></h3>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>[seeing window to SPPPAAAAAACE]</i> Oh my god! Are we on a starship?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah. Now don't go walking off. Stay where I can see you.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Woah! I can see Neptune!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>That's not- whatever.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>No one likes a know-it-all.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well, no one likes an idiot.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Well at least idiots ar-</p>
		<p><b><i>A door opens.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b><i>[groggily]</i> Oi. Where did you come from?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well, we just came to stop by.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Are you authorized to be here?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>My dear boy, are <i>YOU</i> authorized to be here?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Yes. I'm the captain.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[quietly]</i> ohshit</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Language.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Hand over your badges.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What's a badge. OH! Don't have.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>K. You're <i>[yawns]</i> coming with me. <i>[pulls out gun]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Woah!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Nurse, why the hell do you keep getting us into deadly situations?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well, I'm not doing it on purpose.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>[puts up hands]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Look, captain, we just came to, like, check out your ship. A goop monster, an orb monster, and rock octopus took my badge.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>...</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>This is a government vessel. No badge: no entr-<i>[sees Robert]</i> Hold on. Are you-?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Am I what?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>You look like Robert Scott!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I mean, he is. <i>Only if that's a good thing.</i></p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Well, he's the uncle of Will Scott, creator of Starships.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Oh, was he, um, I a foster parent to Will? -A good one?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Obviously.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>huh. <i>[mumbles]</i> not how I remember it...</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>So yeah, we're a big deal.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Um, yes.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b><i>[to Robert]</i> One hell of a face lift, if I may say.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Hey! As his dad, <i>[to Robert]</i> <i>go with this</i>, I want you to apologize.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Y-yeah, these people are authorized.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I'm his dad. <i>[stares at Robert intensely]</i></p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>You look nothing like him.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>HE'S AUTHORIZED, o-ok?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Yeah, me too, if anyone forgot I was here.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Ok, so <i>[wrist communicator buzzes]</i> Uh, hello? Ah. Another one. You know the drill. Take 'em to sick bay. <i>[sad sigh]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Wait what? Is there a disease here?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>No, an infestation.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Of what? <i>[to Nurse]</i> We need to go.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Wildrum.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I pity you. I so pity you.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>What are Wildrum?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I'll tell you when you're older.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>No. Tell me now.</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>They live on meteors and whatever it crashes into becomes property of the Prime Wildrum. They'll kill anyone who stays in their territory and this ship just became their territory.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>How many are on this ship?</p>
		<p><b>CURTIS: </b>Hundreds.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh no... This is really bad. Flower, Robert; back to the <i>RATIS</i>.</p>
		<p><b><i>Something is heard crashing through the vents. A cover is blown off.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Get back!</p>
		<p><b><i>A large green crab claw grabs the <i>RATIS</i> and pulls it into the vent.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>NO! They've taken him!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Oh no.</p>
