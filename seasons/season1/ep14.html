		<p><b><i>A flaming clown mannequin is walking towards Flower, Robert, Charlotte, and Will.</i></b></p>

		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[bursts through wall]</i> Oh! You're here! Kids, do either of you have an extraordinary sense of time?</p>

		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I need to know if you know what time it is.</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>It's 5:59PM.</p>

		<br>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>What the hell is wrong with you?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I might answer, but you will never stop asking that, anyways.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>One last thing before this clown kills us, I've been asking myself this question ever since we met.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Nurse whom?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Nurse whom?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>The Nurse whom's going to save you.</p>
		<p><b>CLOWN: </b><i>[shoots firebolt that lands between Nurse and Flower]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah, should probably address that. DASH!</p>
		<p><b><i>They dash.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>HOW BIG IS THIS PLACE?!?</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>Yes.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I can't tell you, for certain, how big it is, but it may be bigger than my <i>RATIS</i>. .. WAIT! COMMANDER! YOU LANDED MY <i>RATIS</i> in your disguised <i>TYPE 98 RATIS</i>, did you!</p>
		<p><b>COMMANDER: </b><i>[over some sort of speaker]</i> Perhap.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Where's the enterance-why would you tell me that. You aren't stu-</p>
		<p><b>COMMANDER: </b>IDKLOL.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>oh. We have to find my <i>RATIS</i> and get out of here!</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>What is a <i>RATIS</i>? Is that like a pastry?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>It could look like one, I guess... No!</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>I'm Will, by the way. What your name?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I'm the Nurse. Now, WIll, it is very important you answer me this. Why don't <i>you</i> like Robert?</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>Charlotte told me he's a-I don't think I can say that out loud.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>No, please do.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Is this really necessary for our survival?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Robert, shut. Tell me.</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>I'll explain his cuckery.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Please do! <i>[gets into listening position]</i> Robert, shhhhhh....</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>Out real dad got cancer so he sent us to his brother, <i>[gestures to Robert]</i> who is this asswipe you see over there.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>That's it? Robert's not that bad. <i>[to Robert]</i> You may talk now. </p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>I didn't finish college so I could barely keep or find a job... I couldn't support them.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Wait, hold on. Why are you kids here? WAIT HOLD ON! <i>[spots a ladder]</i> Up this ladder! This goes to the next floor! </p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Can that clown even climb? It has no hands!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Exactly!</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>But yeah, all Robert ever did was avoid paying rent and drink in the living room, sobbing like a bitch. I had to take care of Will.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Okay, okay, I got it. Real sad. UP! NOW!! <i>[climbs]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[follows]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>Everyone makes their way up the ladder a second later. As they reach the top, the Nurse begins to speak.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I may have made a huge miscalculation. <i>[uses the <i>SONIC HAMMER</i> to light up the room]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>There, in front of them, is the Pumpkin Man, joined by 20+ plastic ghosts.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Huge miscalculation...</p>
