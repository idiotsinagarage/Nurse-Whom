{Hundred of people are running out of times square.}
Nurse: Oh no. This is bad.
Moth: [opens mouth]
{all the civilians stop moving.}
Nurse: ... What's happening?
{Electricity shoot out of all the civilians eyes and goes into the moth's mouth.}
Nurse: You, are you killing them?
Moth: [jumps off building and flies past a bunch of buildings]
{The windows of the buildings shatter. Civilians are cut by glass shards.}
Robert: NURSE! IT'S COMING RIGHT AT US.
Nurse: what. WHAT. WHAT! (WHAT!)
Flower: [wakes up] What the FUCK IS THAT?
Nurse: idklmfao.
Robert: Dash!
Nurse: My line, but okay.
{They all begin to run.}

--{EPISODE TWENTY-SIX: LAMP}--

Nurse: Now I need to figure out what this thing is. What did I see.... [does big brain stuff] Due to the glowing compound... [calculations whiz] ...max altitude it flew...
Moth: [gaining]
Nurse: [counts on fingers] ...number of eyes... type of saliva... How did it smell-? Sulfur! I got it! It's an alien moth!
Flower: ...
Jack: NO SHIT.
Nurse: It isn't shit. It's an alien moth.
Moth: [roars]
Nurse: See? ALien.
Flower: So how does that help?
Nurse: Now we know it isn't an Earth moth. Big brain!
Flower: But how does that (help)?
Nurse: I didn't think of that.
Flower: Oh, great!
Nurse: You got any other ideas?
Flower: You're the alien expert.
Nurse: That's like saying that just because I am a time traveling alien on your planet means I'm an alien expert.
Robert: Oh no.
{An electricity barrier blocks the exit to time square.}
Nurse: This ain't good.
Moth: [flies upwards]
{the ground cracks.}
Nurse: (ohshit.)
Flower: (ohshit.)
Robert: (ohshit.)
Jack: (ohshit.)
RATIS: [silently] (ohshit.)
Moth: [blows up Brooklyn bridge with lightning from antennas]
Nurse: Oh no. A bridge no one cares about!
Flower: Bruh.
Nurse: I am, in no way, your brother.
Flower: That bridge is well known.
Nurse: Whatever. After it!
Flower: If you are going to steer the (RATIS) again, I'm going to fucking murder you.
Nurse: Then consider me dead. [gets in the RATIS]
Robert: [gets in] Oh, so the plan's "crash into buildings until it goes away?"
Nurse: Perhap. Jack are you coming?
Jack: Yup. [gets in]
Nurse: Aight. Let's get him up in the air! [pulls lever]
RATIS: [sins]
Nurse: [presses blue button]
RATIS: [spins]
Nurse: There we go. Oh, and let's do this [bonks wheel with hammer]
Flower: What was that?
Nurse: Stabilization.
Flower: WHY DIDN'T YOU USE THAT EARLIER?!
Nurse: Deadass hungry. Anyone else want something to eat?
Flower: Just fly.
Nurse: Okay.
Jack: Could go for a (boneless pizza) ngl.
Flower: Tell me how the fuck pizza can be boneless?
NUrse: If it don't got bone in it, it's boneless.
Flower: Dickhead.
Nurse: There it is. Now that we found it, what do we do?
Flower: Why would I know?
Nurse: Robert, got any ideas?
Robert: Uh, lamp?
Jack: Now you're just saying things.
Nurse: Wait! Robert! That's it! We attract it to the (RATIS)'s top lamp. [presses buttons] We just gotta make the lamp on the top of the exterior super bright!
{The lamp is unreasonably bright.}
Flower: We're inside and my eyes still hurt.
Nurse: Correct.
Moth: [flies to RATIS]
Nurse: Now what?
Moth: What is this thing?
Nurse: It speaks. Robert, what do we do?
Robert: Speak back.
Nurse: [over speakers] Who the fuck are you?
Moth: Who are you?
Nurse: I'm the Nurse. Now tell me who you are.
Moth: I go by Lunimor. I am here on an important mission. I recommend staying out of the way.
Nurse: Getting in the way is my thing. Why are you here. I just wanted to go to 1999.
Lunimor: I was sent to this planet to replenish our electricity.
Nurse: By who? Or should I say whom?
Lunimor: By the council of Byorg.
Nurse: Fuck-org?
Lunimor: The leaders of my planet.
Nurse: Well, they're lame.
Lunimor: I have no time for you, aliens. I must complete my mission.
Nurse: I won't let you.
Lunimor: Then you shall die.
NurseL: Don't think so.
Lunimor: [backs up and then starts agressively flapping his wingers at the RATIS, causing huge gusts of wind to blow at it]
{Three buildings are thrown at the RATIS by the wind.}
Nurse: No no no no no. I don't take bad milk from you. [raises shields]
Flower: What is going on.
Nurse: Wind.
Lunimor: [blows more debris at the RATIS]
Nurse: Frick.
