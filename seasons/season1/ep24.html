		<h3><i>-IN A CAVE WITH LASER CAGES-</i></h3>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>My hammer! They've got it!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>I gathered.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Same.</p>

		<h1>NURSE WHOM:</h1>
		<h1>THE RETRIEVAL</h1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b><i>Andrew and Cadmus appear outside of the cave.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b>Five Mississippi.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What? Why are you counting using a river as a unit of time?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Ah dang it. I can't find and off switch for the cages and implosion.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Shit. I could disable it with my hammer, but they have it.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Come on, Robert. Think.</p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b>Four Mississippi.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh no. Well they don't know what they're getting into when they mess with me. This won't work. You may be able to kill them, but you can't kill me!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>...</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>How so?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I'll never tell.</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>Then I call your bluff, Nurse.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>It isnâ€™t a bluff. But I won't let you kill them.</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>There is only way to find out.</p>
		<p><b>ADNREW: </b>Three Mississippi.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Alright we need to get out. Everyone push on a wall!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Uh...</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>We're in laser cages in a cave. How will that help?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Those are lasers?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Are you blind?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>No, but I am brain deaf.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Explains.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>FLOWER, you see the thing next to the Chupacabra?</p>
		ERROR!
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What? What is that?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>HIT ITS SUIT THING! That might be what's-</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[chucks a spoon at it]</i></p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b>One Missi- OW! You fool! <i>[goes to punch Flower]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Don't punch me! Jack: Yeah.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What is going on out there?</p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b><i>[throws punch]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[dodges left]</i></p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b><i>[hits the door to the cave, breaking it]</i> Oh darn.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>AYE!</p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b><i>[tosses hammer to Cadmus]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Get it from them!</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b><i>[grabs the hammer in teeth and runs]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>I'll try. <i>[dashes after Cadmus]</i></p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b><i>[dashes after Flower]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Jack, do something.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>HELP ME!</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[tries to slide between the bars]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>You almost got it!</p>
		<p><b><i>Jack makes it through the laser bars.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Great job!</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[dashes after Andrew]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Kill 'em!</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[dropkicks Andrew and bounces off]</i> That went better in my head.</p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b><i>[turns to Jack]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Not good!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>GOTCHA! <i>[grabs Cadmus]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Grab the hammer!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[loses grip]</i></p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b><i>[uses hammer to produce super loud screech at Flower]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>I went deaf a long time ago. You know how many times the Nurse has fucking done that?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Like three times!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Enough to make me deaf. <i>[grabs hammer]</i> Jack! Catch! <i>[yeets with questionable accuracy]</i></p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[catches]</i> What now?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Use setting 69!</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[does]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>The hammer plays music.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Now I can think. I think these cages my be deadlocked. They aren't stupid enough to deadlock it, right? Try setting 1 to double check.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[uses setting 1 on the cages]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>The cages do not open</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Okay. Now we should use the cutting power. Jack behind you! While you dodge, try setting 283.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[dodges and tries]</i></p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b><i>[stops moving]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>The cages deactivate.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>[runs out of cage]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>There we go.</p>
		<p><b>ANDREW: </b><i>[reactivates suit]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>That isn't good. Hand me the hammer.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Think fast! <i>[yeets hammer to Nurse]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[grabs]</i> Oh, now you're in trouble. Let's see.... <i>[powers down Andrews suit again.]</i> Down boy! Now... There's still Cadmus.</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>Correct. And I warn you, I am quite skilled in fisticuffs.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well, I am probably not. But why would I tell you. Maybe this is a trick.</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b><i>[fires crystal spikes from his back at everyone]</i></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>[ducks]</i></p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[is hit]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE": </b><i>[dodges]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[moves away]</i> JACK!</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>GAH!</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b><i>[charges at Nurse]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>You hurt my friends. TIME FOR A BONK! <i>[bonks Cadmus with hammer causing a visible shockwave on impact]</i></p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b><i>[teleports on the Nurse's shoulder to avoid and bites Nurse's neck and begins to suck blood]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh fuck oh shit oh fuck oh shit!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>[pulls Cadmus off of Nurse]</i></p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b><i>[bites Robert's arm and sucks blood]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Let's try this again. <i>[bonks]</i></p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b><i>[falls off Robert]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Finally.</p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>I do with I could stay, but my ride's here, if I may use the modern nomenclature.</p>
		<p><b><i>A big ol' spaceship appears overhead.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>CADMUS: </b>I will return, Nurse, not for your hammer, but for your life.</p>
		<p><b><i>The spaceship beams Cadmus up and flies away.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>That explains a lot. Maybe you should offer whoever is going to kill me a drink</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>That was bonkers.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Well, this is my last vacation day, so I better get going.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I have something to show you first. Come with me.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Pleeeeeaseeeee?</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Oh, alright.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Over here. That over there is my <i>RATIS</i>.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Looks like an <i>Army Recruitment Box</i>.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>My leprechaun circuit broke. Just step inside.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Wasn't planning on joining the army but- huh? It's bigger on the inside!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Correct. Now, Jack, does you body have a way to sense when to feel tired and when to wake up?</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>You mean a body clock?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>odd question.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Do you know why I am asking?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[to Nurse]</i> I actually want you to do it this time.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Nope.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I just wanted to know if you knew the current time?</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Like 3AM.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>False. Do you know the real time?</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>No?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>KIDNAP!</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>......What?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Kidnap.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>It's the time.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[closes RATIS doors]</i> We're kidnapping you.</p>
		<p><b><i>The RATIS takes off</i></b></p>
