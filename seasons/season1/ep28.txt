::IN THE RATIS, ABOVE A COCOON COVERED TIMES SQUARE::
Nurse: That fucking thing is kidnapping 1999! No fair! I wanted to!
Robert: You can't kidnap a year.
Nurse: Then what is going on right now?
Robert: It's stealing Times Square, not the year 1999.
Nurse: Wait that's New York? I thought that was 1999.
Jack: Oh boy.
Nurse: What  child are you talking to?
Lunimor: [latches to top of cocoon]

--{EPISODE TWNETY-EIGHT: COCOON}--

Nurse: Look!
Lunimor: The dish known as pizza is quite delectable. Especially when the ingredients are separated.
Nurse: Big brain.
Flower: Big big brain.
Jack: Ooooookay then.
Nurse: Now what do we do?! I mean, we have to save 1999. 
Flower: Times FUCKING Square.
Nurse: It's 1999. Why would the button be called 1999 if it takes us to Times Square.
Flower: [kicks Nurse in the groin]
Lunimor: The new cattle is on board. Sir, we will arrive in three days.
Nurse: Flower, you fool, my balls are near my stomach.
Flower: [punches him in the stomach]
Nurse: Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck FUUUUCK!
Jack: [gets out of the RATIS and attempts to climb up the side of the cocoon, falls] Damn, it's all slippery.
Nurse: [puts superglue on Jack's hands] not anymore.
Jack: [attempts again] The liquid in the cocoon is dissolving the glue!
Nurse: Oh no! NO! Oh... [grabs magnets and puts them on his hands] maybe this'll help.
{Jack fails as the cocoon is not made of metal.}
Flower: You idiot.
Jack: Let's try climbing the buildings.
Nurse: Great idea!
Flower: Uh... Nurse, look at Robert.
Robert: What's wrong with me?
Nurse: Oh dear.
Robert: What? Is it that I'm ascending towards the giant moth- AAAAAHHHHH!!!!
Lunimor: [pulling Robert up with electricity]
Nurse: Robert, I can't reach you!
Jack: [running up the floors of the tallest building]
Flower: [follows]
Nurse: WAIT UP!
Jack: What is it?
Nurse: I need to catch up! I was too busy looking at the ascending 1999.
Jack: [continues upwards]
Lunimor: [puts Robert on his back]
Jack: [on top of building] Stop right there!
Lunimor: No.
Jack: Let our friend go or I'll... uh..... hmmm....
Lunimor: [prepares lightning antennas]
Nurse: Oh no. Let's think. According to the conductivity of air, distance of conductors... [think while calculation whiz] ...strength of current... [eyes flick back and fourth]
Flower: What are you thinking?
Nurse: Well let's see... humidity... local temperatures.... [pulls out dehumidifier]
Jack: [frantically dodging lightning]
{The dehumidifier begins to dehumidify the air.}
Nurse: Now that should reduce the conductivity of the air.
Flower: Humid air will just replace it.
Nurse: oh- [cranks it to full 69 times] That should do it.
{The air gets really dry and everyone's nose starts to bleed a little.}
Lunimor: What are you trying to accomplish?
Nurse: Look at your electric beams! They're no more harmful than static now!
Lunimor: What? NO!
Nurse: It's my handy-dandy type 98 dehumidifier.
Flower: So you steal a type 69 RATIS by a type 98 dehumidifier?
Nurse: I told you I had a gut feeling.
Lunimor: No matter. I shall ram you!
Nurse: Fuck.
Lunimor: [rams]
Jack: [runs]
Robert: OH SHI-
Lunimor: [bursts through building, ripping it in half]
Nurse: DASH!
Jack: [falling noises]
Flower: What do you think we're doing?!
Nurse: JACK! Flower, you get Jack. I got Robert.
Flower: Okay! [goes]
Jack: At least I'll have the weirdest death in history...
Nurse: False.
Flower: Jack! Grab my hand!
Nurse: Not a good idea.
Flower: Then what do I do?
Nurse: Not that. Now, Robert, you're just going to have to sit there a minute. [to Lunimor] Now, I need some more answers you fucking moth retard.
Flower: That's offensive.
Nurse: If you're afraid of offending people, then don't talk. But when you do speak, make sure it's to the right person.
Lunimor: [charges at Nurse]
Nurse: And you, Lunimor, are a fucked up guy. Stealing 1999. Stop charging or I'll blow it up! [pulls out hammer]
Lunimor: [stops] How do you intend on blowing up a year?
Nurse: What do you mean, year? We're on 1999 right now.
Lunimor: You are referring to Times Square.
Nurse: Why the hell is everyone calling this Times Square? I press 1999, I go to FUCKING 1999!
Robert: Yes, the YEAR 1999, which has Times Square in it, which is where we are.
Lunimor: Silence, lunch.
Nurse: Don't you mean Robert Scott, the tragic loser who no one loves?
Lunimor: What do you need answers to?
Nurse: Why do you need 1999?
Lunimor: After my country's livestock was killed by the Awakening, we picked up large traces of electricity here.
Nurse: What awakening?
Lunimor: The elders sensed something awaken in the shadowed places from within. Something powerful, something evil, caused a rift in the astral plane.
Nurse: What the fuck is an astral plane?
Lunimor: The source of all psychic energy. A manifestation of the minds of all things.
Nurse: I heard there was a pheonix.
Lunimor: There were rumors of a gateway to Origos opening temporarily. 
Nurse: Origos? The FUCK si an Origos?
Lunimor: The legendary hidden planet.
Nurse: I repeat, what the FUCK is an Oreo Ghost?
Lunimor: You of all people should know, Nurse.
Jack: [still falling]
Flower: It's a long way down. Fuck it this usually works... [jumps out window]
Nurse: What was that... FLOWER! OH NO! Anyways, keep talking.
Flower: [falling] Wait what was I thinking? I'm going to die.
Jack: [grabs convenient flagpole]
Flower: GRAB ME!
{Jack grabs her out of the air.}
Flower: Thank goodness.
Nurse: Go on... we don't have all Times Square.
Lunimor: Nor do I. [knocks hammer out of Nurse's hand]
Nurse: Well, I wasn't actually going to blow up 1999 anyways, so...
Robert: USE THE SUPER-MURDERBALL-DEATH0KIL!!! I BROKE THE COMPRESSION FIELD ON HIS BACK-
Nurse: But I'm not that close to the (RATIS)!
Flower: I am!
Nurse: Am I that loud?
Flower: Louder. [enters the RATIS and activates the sky torpedoes]
RATIS: [sins out of control]
Lunimor: Well shit. [is super-murderball-death-killed]
Nurse: That was anticlimactic.
Robert: Let;s get 1999 back down.
Nurse: Good boy, Robert.
Robert: [enters RATIS]
Nurse: [enters]
Jack: [enters]
Nurse: Now... 199 lowering button is right here.... [slams with hammer]
{1999 is lowered.}
Flower: We did it.
Nurse: Yeah.
Robert: Is anyone going to remember this?
Nurse: Well, everyone was so fucking drunk, so no. Now off we GO!
