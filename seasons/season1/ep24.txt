::IN A CAVE WITH LASER CAGES::
Nurse: My hammer! They've got it!
Robert: I gathered.
Flower: Same.

--{EPISODE TWENTY-FOUR: THE RETRIEVAL}--

{Andrew and Cadmus appear outside of the cave.}
Andrew: Five Mississippi.
Nurse: What? Why are you counting using a river as a unit of time?
Robert: Ah dang it. I can't find and off switch for the cages and implosion.
Nurse: Shit. I could disable it with my hammer, but they have it.
Robert: Come on, Robert. Think.
Andrew: Four Mississippi.
Nurse: Oh no. Well they don't know what they're getting into when they mess with me. This won't work. You may be able to kill them, but you can't kill me!
Flower: ...
Cadmus: How so?
Nurse: I'll never tell.
Cadmus: Then I call your bluff, Nurse.
Nurse: It isnâ€™t a bluff. But I won't let you kill them.
Cadmus: There is only way to find out.
Adnrew: Three Mississippi.
Nurse: Alright we need to get out. Everyone push on a wall!
Flower: Uh...
Robert: We're in laser cages in a cave. How will that help?
Nurse: Those are lasers?
Flower: Are you blind?
Nurse: No, but I am brain deaf.
Flower: Explains.
Robert: FLOWER, you see the thing next to the Chupacabra?
Andrew Two Mississippi.
Nurse: What? What is that?
Robert: HIT ITS SUIT THING! That might be what's-
Flower: [chucks a spoon at it]
Andrew: One Missi- OW! You fool! [goes to punch Flower]
Flower: Don't punch me! Jack: Yeah.
Nurse: What is going on out there?
Andrew: [throws punch]
Flower: [dodges left]
Andrew: [hits the door to the cave, breaking it] Oh darn.
Nurse: AYE!
Andrew: [tosses hammer to Cadmus]
Nurse: Get it from them!
Cadmus: [grabs the hammer in teeth and runs]
Flower: I'll try. [dashes after Cadmus]
Andrew: [dashes after Flower]
Nurse: Jack, do something.
Flower: HELP ME!
Jack: [tries to slide between the bars]
Nurse: You almost got it!
{Jack makes it through the laser bars.}
Nurse: Great job!
Jack: [dashes after Andrew]
Flower: Kill 'em!
Jack: [dropkicks Andrew and bounces off] That went better in my head.
Andrew: [turns to Jack]
Nurse: Not good!
Flower: GOTCHA! [grabs Cadmus]
Nurse: Grab the hammer!
Flower: [loses grip]
Cadmus: [uses hammer to produce super loud screech at Flower]
Flower: I went deaf a long time ago. You know how many times the Nurse has fucking done that?
Nurse: Like three times!
Flower: Enough to make me deaf. [grabs hammer] Jack! Catch! [yeets with questionable accuracy]
Jack: [catches] What now?
Nurse: Use setting 69!
Jack: [does]
{The hammer plays music.}
Nurse: Now I can think. I think these cages my be deadlocked. They aren't stupid enough to deadlock it, right? Try setting 1 to double check.
Jack: [uses setting 1 on the cages]
{The cages do not open}
Nurse: Okay. Now we should use the cutting power. Jack behind you! While you dodge, try setting 283.
Jack: [dodges and tries]
Andrew: [stops moving]
{The cages deactivate.}
Robert: [runs out of cage]
Nurse: There we go.
Andrew: [reactivates suit]
Nurse: That isn't good. Hand me the hammer.
Jack: Think fast! [yeets hammer to Nurse]
Nurse: [grabs] Oh, now you're in trouble. Let's see.... [powers down Andrews suit again.] Down boy! Now... There's still Cadmus.
Cadmus: Correct. And I warn you, I am quite skilled in fisticuffs.
Nurse: Well, I am probably not. But why would I tell you. Maybe this is a trick.
Cadmus: [fires crystal spikes from his back at everyone]
Robert: [ducks]
Jack: [is hit]
Nurse": [dodges]
Flower: [moves away] JACK!
Jack: GAH!
Cadmus: [charges at Nurse]
Nurse: You hurt my friends. TIME FOR A BONK! [bonks Cadmus with hammer causing a visible shockwave on impact]
Cadmus: [teleports on the Nurse's shoulder to avoid and bites Nurse's neck and begins to suck blood]
Nurse: Oh fuck oh shit oh fuck oh shit!
Robert: [pulls Cadmus off of Nurse]
Cadmus: [bites Robert's arm and sucks blood]
Nurse: Let's try this again. [bonks]
Cadmus: [falls off Robert]
Nurse: Finally.
Cadmus: I do with I could stay, but my ride's here, if I may use the modern nomenclature.
{A big ol' spaceship appears overhead.}
Cadmus: I will return, Nurse, not for your hammer, but for your life.
{The spaceship beams Cadmus up and flies away.}
Nurse: That explains a lot. Maybe you should offer whoever is going to kill me a drink
Jack: That was bonkers.
Nurse: Yeah.
Jack: Well, this is my last vacation day, so I better get going.
Nurse: I have something to show you first. Come with me.
Flower: Pleeeeeaseeeee?
Jack: Oh, alright.
Nurse: Over here. That over there is my (RATIS).
Jack: Looks like an (Army Recruitment Box).
Nurse: My leprechaun circuit broke. Just step inside.
Jack: Wasn't planning on joining the army but- huh? It's bigger on the inside!
Nurse: Correct. Now, Jack, does you body have a way to sense when to feel tired and when to wake up?
Jack: You mean a body clock?
Nurse: Yeah.
Jack: odd question.
Nurse: Do you know why I am asking?
Flower: [to Nurse] I actually want you to do it this time.
Jack: Nope.
Nurse: I just wanted to know if you knew the current time?
Jack: Like 3AM.
Nurse: False. Do you know the real time?
Jack: No?
Nurse: KIDNAP!
Jack: ......What?
Nurse: Kidnap.
Flower: It's the time.
Nurse: [closes RATIS doors] We're kidnapping you.
{The RATIS takes off}
