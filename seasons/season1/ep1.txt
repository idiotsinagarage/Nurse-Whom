::IN A FACTORY::
Flower: I am job work.
Action Figures: [moving noises]
Flower: Do you actually think you're fucking funny?
Action Figures: [evil moving noises]
Flower: Noh o!
Nurse: Dash at a high speed!

--{EPISODE 1: THE NOT-FROM-EARTH PEOPLE}--

::OUTSIDE THE FACTORY::
Nurse: I sure hope The Commander isn't here!
Flower: Who?
Commander: I hear cymbals... The never ending cymbals! Am I still the only one who can hear the cymbals?
Nurse: Yes. Yes you are. But I can fix it.
Commander: Why should I trust you?
Flower: What the fuck is going on!?!
Nurse: What's your name?
Flower: Flower Tyler.
Nurse: Nice to meet you Flower Tyler... DASH AT A HIGH SPEED!
Flower: [dashes at a high speed like a fricking walrus]
Nurse: Now Commander... why are you here?
Commander: You know why.
Nurse: I thought those were being controlled by the Nest-In Consciousness [points to action figures]
Commander: Nurse, Nurse, Nurse...
Nurse: Commander, Commander Comma-
Commander: Shut. Shut up.
Nurse: NO!
Commander: Why not?
Nurse: I'm just saving the world from you!
Commander: Just like old times.
Nurse: Just like o-
{BOOM! The building Flower work-jobbed in explodes sending Nurse and Commander flying backwards.}
Nurse: People were in there!
Commander: That is why it is all the more fun to blow it up!
Nurse: No! Every one of those people had lives! You killed them all in one go, like it was child's play!
Commander: Amazing isn't it?
Nurse: You're coming with me in my 'RATIS'!
Commander: Not yours if you stole it.
Nurse: It is now!
Commander: Why'd you have to steal a 'TYPE 69 RATIS'? The 'TYPE 98's are the newest.
Nurse: A gut feeling.
Commander: None the less... I am still not going!
Nurse: Yes you are!
{The Commander flickers like a failing hologram and then fades out, leaving behind a glitching image of himself.}
Nurse: No!
Action Figures: [grabs the nurse's arm and pin him to the ground]
Action Figure 1: [in a deep robotic voice] Ready the device!
Action Figure 2: Transporter ready!
Nurse: N-n-n-no! I am not using one of-
{The Nurse fades away.}

::ON A SPACESHIP::
Nurse: -those! Now what have I gotten myself into?
{The main console beeps.}
Nurse: This is 'Temporal Ruler' technology!
Commander: [walking out from behind a corner] Yes! This is my 'RATIS.' My first order of business is to break the 'LEPRECHAUN CIRCUIT' of your 'RATIS,' making it stuck as an Army Recruitment Box!
Nurse: NO!
Commander: I have a 'TYPE 98 RATIS.' I can do as I like! [flips lever]
Nurse: Monster.
Commander: I thought we were friends.
Nurse: We were... but you have hurt too many.
Commander: I thought you enjoyed action.
Nurse: Action and death are very different!
Commander: Not in my eyes.
Nurse: Your eyes are wrong!
Commander: I'm not the one being held by action figures.
Nurse: How will I ever get out of this situation? Wait a second... I've never seen a console like this before.
Commander: Yeah well this is the quality you get rom a 'TYPE 98 RATIS.'
Nurse: I don't like it.
Commander: You know, we can never go back now. We're criminals. They hate us.
Nurse: The council of the 'CITY: DELL' is forgiving.
Commander: Really?
Nurse: NOPE! Just need to get you distracted!
Commander: What does tha-
{The action figures are no longer on The Nurse's arms but The Commander's.}
Commander: NO!!!!
Nurse: [opens doors] As people say... BYE!
{He exits to realize the 'LEPRECHAUN CIRCUIT' disguised The Commander's 'RATIS' as a bathroom stall.}
Nurse: Suiting. Now where is my 'RATIS?'
{He runs out of the building to see he was only a few buildings down from the explosion. He walks out to see Flower standing there looking around to try to see anything.}
Nurse: Flower, do you want to come with me?
Flower: No.
Nurse: Can I at least show you my 'RATIS?' It's a SPACE MACHINE!
Flower: Like... sure then...?
Nurse: There it is... oh I forgot it still looked like this.
Flower: It's an Army Recruitment Box.
Nurse: On the outside! [opens the door with a key]
Flower: How can this be a- [is shoved in by Nurse] It's interior is larger than its exterior!
Nurse: True! Guess what time it is!
Flower: What?
Nurse: KIDNAP!
Flower: No! Why?
Nurse: I don't have a granddaughter so you need to be mine! WHO LIKES CAVE MEN?!
Flower: This is worse than burglary!
