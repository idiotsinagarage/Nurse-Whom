::IN THE RATIS::
Flower: You know, I need a day of break from all of this chaos. What do you say, Nurse?
Nurse: I mean, I can try... but you know I have no idea how to land this thing.
Flower: Oh, whatever.
Nurse: Look, I just took off in this thing and never looked back.
Flower: Did you take an instructional manual?
Nurse: No. They tell you what to do.
Flower: What's wrong with that?
Nurse: No one tells me what to do. Now, if you could just hold your finger on that button there...
Jack: Are we in space right now?
Robert: Possibly.
Nurse: I could open the doors and we could get sucked out if you aren't sure.
Robert: Bruh.
Nurse: Hold the button, Jack.
Flower: ..
Jack: [places finger upon button]
Nurse: Aight.
Jack: What's this button do?
Nurse: So Flower, what were you thinking about when you meant break?
Flower: I don't know. Maybe, like, a party.
Nurse: Okay... Well I do have a 1999 button. Every (RATIS) has one.
Flower: Fuck kind of button?
Nurse: Well your car has a go button. My (RATIS) has a 1999 button. What's so wrong with that?
Robert: Cars have gas pedals, actually.
Flower: Have you ever been to 1999?
Nurse: When? I've never heard of that year...
Flower: You idiot.
Nurse: No, I'm Nurse.
Jack: What've I gotten myself into.
Nurse: The (RATIS). Can't you read?
Jack: It says "Army Recruitment Inside."
Nurse: That’s big-brain for (RATIS).
Jack: Suuuuuuuure....
Nurse: You're just dumb.
Flower: [blushes] No, he's not.
Robert: Let's just get to 1999.
Nurse: HELL YEAH! [slams head on button]

::1999 - NEW YEAR'S EVE::
Nurse: Shit, dawg. My head.
Flower: I thought it was funny.
Nurse: Same.
Robert: [opens RATIS doors]
Nurse: You know the temporal ruler who invented the 1999 button was dreaming when he made it. Imma explain it, but tell me it if goes astray, but they woke up that morning. They could've sworn it was judgement day. The sky was purple, there were people running everywhere.
Flower: THAT'S JUST THE LYRICS TO 1999!
Nurse: Well, where did you think Prince got 'em? His brain? HELL NO.
{All around them is times square.}
Nurse: Cool. What's the time?
Flower: Kidnap?
Nurse: Not yet. The fake time. The one stupid species use.
Jack: [to crowd person] Excuse me, what time is it?
Crowd Person: Midnight! WOOOO! I'M SO TIRED! [falls asleep]
Nurse: Fuck kind of time is that?
Jack: 12:00.
Nurse: Ah, so not it's 2000?
Other Person: In 10 seconds.
Nurse: Ah... Jack, you're dumb.
Flower: I remember this bit. We all thought everything would stop working.
Nurse: Well, you were idiots.
Flower: Yep.
Nurse: Yep.
Everyone: 10!
Nurse: 9!
Flower: 8!
Robert: 7!
Jack: 6!
Everyone: 5! 4! 3! 2!
{Times square loses power and goes dark.}
Robert: Wot?
Flower: I don’t remember this.
Jack: Yeah, what the hell?
Nurse: What? Did this not happen? Your planet's lame.
{A humongous glowing green object flies into the New Year's ball. The ball shatters.}
Nurse: [eats popcorn]
Flower: Where did you get that.
Nurse: My powers of summoning comical items at convenient times is on of my Temporal Ruler abilities.
{The shards from the ball cut everyone around them.}
Nurse: Cool. It sounds like someone paid extra for the sound system.
Flower: This is real.
Nurse: What's the difference?
Flower: Wait...
{The glowing green thing zooms off into the distance.}
Nurse: Everyone! In the (RATIS)! [enters]
{Everyone else enters with him.}
Nurse: Know what time it is?
Flower: I think I d-
Nurse: KIDNAP! [pulls lever]
{The RATIS begins to sin out of control.}
Nurse: JACK! THE BLUE BUTTON!
Jack: [hits the blue button]
{The RATIS spins out of control.}
Nurse: Now, Imma need a steering wheel. [opens floor board and pulls out a Wii steering wheel] Go time.
Flower: How will that fly the (RA-)- WOAH! Is that working?!
Nurse: You bet your sorry ass it is! [flies the RATIS towards the green thing]
{As they approach, they see the giant green thing is a glowing moth. It zooms around. The RATIS stays in pursuit.}
Flower: Was there a piloting test for these things back on your home world?
Nurse: Yup.
Flower: Did you pass it?
Nurse: Pass what?
Flower: We're going to fucking die.
{The moth lands on a building, causing the Earth to shake.}
Nurse: Ha ha, losers. You aren't in the sky!
{The interior of the RATIS rumbles.}
Nurse: I stand corrected.
Flower: You can't even pilot this thing.
{All the civilians fall into sinkholes caused by the moth's landing.}
Nurse: Well, you see, I can fly it when I can't hit anything.
Flower: Like, in the sky?
Nurse: Yeah, but there are- [voice tenses as a swerves the wheel] BUILDINGS! Buildings everywhere! We're going to hit one!
Robert: OH GOD!
Nurse: AAAAHHHHHHH!!! [pulls up on wheel]
{The RATIS scrapes the roof of and apartment building.}
Nurse: OH NO!
{The RATIS crashes through the Empire State Building.}
Nurse: They won't notice that... right?
Jack: Noticed or not, I ain't paying for that.
Flower: A hole in the side of an iconic building in the shape of an Army Recruitment Box? Naw.
Nurse: Robert, Are you okay?
Robert: NO!
Flower: Shut up, Robert. No one cares.
Nurse: Yeah, Robert. BUILDING!
{The RATIS interior rumbles, causing everyone to fall over.}
Nurse: [drops wheel] DON'T LET IT ROLL!
{The wheel rolls across the floor.}
Nurse: We gon die. We actually gon die.
{The RATIS sins out of control while spinning and crashing through every building.}
Flower: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!
Nurse: KIIIIIDNAAAAAAAAAAAPPPP!!!!
Robert: AAAAAHHHH!!!
Jack: AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!
Nurse: WOOOOOOHOOOOOO!!!!
Flower: HOW THE HELL ARE YOU ENJOYING THIS?!?
Nurse: Well, if we are going to die, I'm at least going to enjoy it.
Robert: [stumbles towards RATIS controls]
Nurse: NOO!!! I mean- [in high pitched voice] WEEEEEEEE!!!
Robert: Where are the brakes?
Nurse: The what?
Robert: The brakes!
Nurse: What are those?
Flower: Shit.
Nurse: Yeah, dawg.
{The RATIS goes plummeting towards the street.}
Nurse: AAAHHH!!!! THOSE G's ARE IN-SANE!
Flower: What is wrong with you?
Nurse: I can't even begin to tell you.
Flower: oh, GREAT!
Nurse: TRUCK! Toss me the wheel! Jack, it’s closest to you!
Jack: [yeets wheel]
Nurse: [catches] Hell yeah! [steers]
{The RATIS narrowly dodges the truck.}
Nurse: Traffic is crazy tonight. I can't dodge it all.
Flower: Then go above it.
Nurse: I can't hear you.
Flower: For fuck's sake, give me the wheel.
Nurse: NO!
Flower: [grabs it from him]
Nurse: [grabs it back]
RATIS: [swerves]
Nurse: Now look what you'v-
Flower: [grabs but does it it out of Nurse's hands]
Nurse: [fights for it back]
RATIS: [yeets car off the road]
Nurse: He's sinning again! Jack! The blue one!
Nurse: Again! It isn't working!
Flower: GIVE ME!
Nurse: Hands off!
Flower: You can't drive.
Nurse: And that makes you think you can?
Jack: ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA! [hitting blue button]
RATIS: [yeets another car off the road]
Nurse: It isn't working.
Flower: GIVE ME THE WHEEL!
Nurse: [punches Flower in the gut]
Flower: [drops wheel]
Nurse: Thank you [steadies them]
Flower: Has anyone ever told you not to punch a girl?
Nurse: You're a girl?
Flower: Fuck you.
Nurse: Please don't. That would be gay. Wait, no. I just remembered.
Flower: Just stop.
Nurse: Okay! [chucks wheel]
RATIS: [becomes demonic]
Robert: [grabs wheel]
RATIS: [plays unholy music]
Nurse: MAKE IT STOP! MY EARS!
Robert: [drives RATIS onto the sidewalk]
Nurse: Oh. Press the green button.
Jack: [hits green button]
RATIS: [plays Halleluiah]
Nurse: Halleluiah.
Robert: What the hell was that?
Nurse: Flower took the wheel and the (RATIS) began to sin to the point of playing 6ix 9ine.
Nurse: My... head...
Nurse: good.
Flower: what.. did... you... what did you say...?
Nurser: Nothing.
Flower: K. [passes out]
Nurse: Finally.
Moth: [roars and shoots lightning from its mouth into the sky]
Nurse: That ain't good.
