		<p><b>LIT: </b><i>[also appearing, knocks Matchstick to the ground with flail]</i> </p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Hey! he was only trying to help the helpless.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>I guess so.</p>
		<p><b>LIT: </b>The helpless are our game! None shall interfere with the hunt.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Then you are stupid.</p>

		<p><b><i>The blades slice Nurse, Flower, and Will</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>OUCH!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>SHIT!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Language.</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>Gah.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>How are we going to get out of this</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Idk lomfa</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>NO! <i>[picks up will and is cut]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>DON'T MOVE!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Why?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>They're everywhere. Time to fly! <i>By the way, does anyone know how to fly?</i></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>No.</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>No.</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>No.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>No.</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b>No.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well, us <i>TEMPORAL RULER</i>s can, but only has long as gravity allows it.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>THAT'S JUMPING!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Sounds lame when you say it that way. Well then, wait oh no! I have disease!</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b>Only Fire Battlers can see and hear them. I'll t-try to deactivate them.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[fake coughs]</i> I think I caught cancer!</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>Just stop.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>No actually. Like I think I have a transmittable cancer. Everyone stay back! <i>[starts to glow]</i></p>
		<p><b>NFURNACE: </b>Why don't I make it easier. Discs, go for Matchstick.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I'M FUCKING GLOWING! IS THIS NOT FRIGHTENING?!</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b><i>[is cut by several blades]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I caught cancer and now I'M FUCKING GLOWING! Is anyone going to look at me?</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b><i>[is trying to hack the blades, but collapses]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>NO! I may have caner, but I still have a heart. Well, three to be exact. Now will someone get this cancer the fuck out of me?!</p>
		<p><b>BLADES: </b><code>|SELF DESTRUCT ACTIVATED|</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh no.</p>
		<p><b>FURNACE: </b>Oh shi- <i>[violently explodes]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Are we going to be safe?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>It's Christmas on Mars and I caught cancer and started glowing! I don't know anymore!</p>
		<p><b>LIT: </b><i>[swings flail at Matchstick]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>EXTRAPOLATE THE FANS!</p>
		<p><b><i>The fans extrapolate, sucking Lit into a pit vent.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I don't have cancer, by the way!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>We did it.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Not yet. I wanted everyone to ignore me. By being blatant in trying to get attention, no one payed attention to what I was actually doing, letting me hack all of the fans. But yeah, we are surrounded by non-spinning blades.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Which stopped us from getting sucked up!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Correct. YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THAT MEANS YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>IT'S CHRISTMAS! ON MARS!</p>
		<p><b><i>Lit has been dead for quite some time now.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b>Okay teh, why don't I take you back to your ship.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Are you serious? An epic moment is happening. Whatever. Let's GO!</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b>F-follow me...</p>
		<p><b><i>They begin towards the RATIS.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Cool.</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>How about instead of Mars, you actually take me to my house.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well that would require me to figure out how to fly my ship. So how about NO.</p>
		<br>
		<h3><i>-AT THE RATIS-</i></h3>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>Bye bye, burning guy!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Thanks for Christmas!</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b>Uh, you're welcome.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>This is my ship! I bet I could use the "FAST RETURN" feature to go back to the last spot.</p>
		<p><b><i>They all enter, leaving Matchstick behind.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>This is the first time I'll be de-kidnapping someone. WHO WANTS TO GO HOME?!</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>Me.</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>Same.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>TWO HOMES COMING RIGHT UP!</p>
		<p><b><i>The RATIS defabricates.</i></b></p>
