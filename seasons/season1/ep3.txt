Nurse: Cock and ball torture?
Flower: Nurse!
Think Spoiler: WORSE.
Nurse: Flower, we have to help them.
Flower: But innocent people will die.
Nurse: Yeah, but I don't want to find out what's worse than cock and ball torture.
Flower: Well... Then you're evil and selfish.
Nurse: That I may be.
Spoiler: QUIT YOUR PERSONAL DISCUSSIONS. YOU ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY ONE!

Think Spoiler: [rotates to the music whilst laughing maniacally]
Nurse: AW! THIS IS AWFUL!
Flower: Make it stop!
{In the cell, there are parts to make the (Spoilerizer).}
Nurse: Seriously though. Could this entire world be from my own future? I can't be here.
Think Spoiler: [rotates faster]
Nurse: [quietly to Flower] I have an idea of how to get us out of here.
Flower: Really?
Nurse: Yes. [to Think Spoiler] Do you know who I am?
Think Spoiler: LOSER SAYS WHAT?
Nurse: I'm the Nurse. Search your archive for me.

Think Spoiler: IT IS A BLENDED CHAIR FROM IKEA.
Nurse: What does that mean?
Flower: And why is it green?

Nurse: OH! Wait you went back into the archive room,right? It all makes sense. He went to purse the archive of the beetle porn.
