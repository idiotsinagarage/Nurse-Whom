::ON THE BOUNTY HUNTER SPACESHIP::
{The bounty hunters are just boarding.}
Sheoherds Noy: That was easy.
Drolis: [poses with glocks]
Syrix: I bet The Nurse won't follow us.

::MEANWHILE ON EARTH::
{The gang is making a mad dash for the (RATIS).}
Nurse: Come on! We might lose them!
Flower: How will you follow them if you can't fly it?
Nurse: I can fly it! (Landing's) the issue.
{They arrive on the rooftop with the (RATIS), shield deactivated. The gang stops to breathe for a second.}
Nurse: They have my hammer, Robert. I want my hammer, Robert. [gets closer to Robert] I (NEED) my hammer, Robert. [now nose-to-nose with Robert] Do you understand that, Robert?
Robert: Oooohhhhh, you're crazy.
Nurse: [snaps back to normal] No, you're just boring. The field is down. Let's go!
{Nurse and Flower enter the (RATIS).}
Robert: Well, I have nothing better to do. [enters]

--{EPISODE EIGHT: THE CHASE}--

::INSIDE THE (RATIS)::
Nurse: Now let's get him up in the air [hits controls]
{Outside, the (RATIS), instead of defabricating, starts to hover.}
Robert: The interior is larger than the exterior!
Nurse: Shut up. [flies the (RATIS) towards the bounty hunter ship]
Flower: Nurse, what the hell are you doing?
Nurse: We have to get onto that ship!
Flower: Why like this?
Nurse: I can't land!

::BACK ON THE HUNTER SHIP::
Drolis: [singing] Sometimes I feel I've got to [fires gun twice] run away! I've-
Computer: |ALERT! SOME RETARDS ARE FOLLOWING YOU WEEEWOOOO WEEEWOOOO|.
{The computer screen shows an incoming facetime audio call from a Centigrade, F. Sheoherds Noy answers it.}
Nurse: [over facetime audio] YO MOTHER FUCKERS!
Flower: Nurse!
Sheoherds Noy: Oh heck. Shooting time.
Nurse: Not going to ask how I'm calling you over facetime audio?
Sheoherds Noy: How are you contacting meh?
{On the (RATIS), Robert is having a midlife crisis in the corner.}
Nurse: Are you having a midlife crisis? You're like 24!
Robert: How did you know that?
Nurse: I'll tell you when you're older.
Sheoherds Noy: Answer my question.
Nurse: I stuck an iPhone 5 in your goop. See?
Syrix: Bruh.
Nurse: Hey it was intimidating for a second, right?
Flower: Not really.
Robert: Eh.
Nurse: Oh shut up. NOW THEN! Who's going to kill me? [pauses] Don't answer that. It's not going to happen.
Flower: [chuckles]
Nurse: I heard that.
Sheoherds Noy: Syrix, prepare the (SUPER MURDER BALL DEATH KILL).
Syrix: I gotchu, fam.
Nurse: (Ah). That's not good. Luckily I'm in a (RATIS).
Flower: It's only (TYPE 69).
Nurse: DON'T TELL THEM! Oh, Robert, when did you get here?
Robert: Bruh.
Nurse: I don't know what that means.
Flower: Bruh.
{A (SUPER MURDER BALL DEATH KILL) is launched at the (RATIS).}
Nurse: This might be risky, but I'm going to try to land on their ship.
Flower: You can't land, right? Didn't you just say that?
Nurse: Crashing it is, then!
Flower: NO!
Nurse: [hits literally every button]
Robert: Isn't it a (SUPER MURDER BALL DEATH KILL)? Wouldn't that, you know, KILL US?!
{The (RATIS) sins, yes sins, out of control.}
Nurse: Oops. [turns on Christian mode]
{The (RATIS) spins out of control.}
Flower: You're insane!
Nurse: Sure. And I'm the President of Great Britain.
Robert: WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT LIKE YOU'RE SERIOUS ASDFGHJKLL
Nurse: I KNOW!
{The (RATIS) crashes into the (SUPER MURDER BALL DEATH KILL), bouncing it away.}
Nurse: WOAH!
{Everyone is knocked over but safe.}
Nurse: Now to get onto that ship and get the (SONIC HAMMER) back.

::BACK ON THE BOUNTY HUNTER SHIP::
Sheoherds Noy: Stupid (TEMPORAL RULER) bullshit. Teleport them on board so we can kill him here.
Nurse: [from the call] Oh do shut up. By the way, you can't end the facetime audio. Facetime never dies.
Syrix: [teleports the (RAITS) on board] 
Nurse: Wait, how did you do that? Oh. No I know. I have a (TYPE 69).
Flower: Seriously, why didn't you steal a (TYPE 98)?
Nurse: A gut feeling. [stepping out] Now, where is my hammer?!!!!
{In front of The Nurse, the hammer sits in a comically large mousetrap next to Drolis.}
Drolis: Go ahead... Take it.
Nurse: Well when you put it that way... [pulls out a mousetrap suppressor from comically large pocket] I'll help myself.
{The Nurse walks over and grabs the hammer and the trap doesn't go off.}
Nurse: Luckily I came prepared. You know, I'm going to say the (D-WORD)... DASH! Dash as far away from here as you can go! I don't care who your employer is. You can leave. You should leave. I'm saying a lot.
Flower: Yeah, you need to shut up.
Drolis: Okay, fuck this. (AMERICA TIME)! [pulls out glocks]
Nurse: GET DOWN!!
