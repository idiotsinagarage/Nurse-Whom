		<h3><i>-DEEP IN THE JUNGLE-</i></h3>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>I think we lost them. What happened to the Nurse?</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>I think he's way back.</p>
		<br>
		<h3><i>-WITH THE NURSE-</i></h3>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>So the game begins. Let's make it more interesting. <i>[pulls out hammer]</i> No <i>SONIC HAMMER</i>. <i>[pulls off cap on the bottom]</i> Now, if you would kindly remove your weapons.</p>
		<p><b><i>Crickets.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Guess their hearing isn't as good as I thought.</p>
		<p><b><i>The ground under the Nurse starts to collapse.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>This can't be good.</p>
		<p><b><i>The Nurse falls into the pit. A metal sheet begins to cover the pit.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh, I wonder what this thing does...</p>
		<p><b><i>The pit becomes fully covered.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Shit, I can't see anything. </p>
		<br>

		<h3><i>-MEANWHILE, AT THE OASIS-</i></h3>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b><i>[places several metal discs around Will]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>The discs turn invisible.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b>The trap is set.</p>
		<p><b>LIT: </b><i>[arrives]</i> Blaze, The <i>TEMPORAL RULER</i> is around the pit trap.</p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b>Very well. Let's get going. Chop chop.</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>This sucks.</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b>Yeah...</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>AAAAAHHH-</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b>Shhhh. If they catch me helping you they'll kill me.</p>
		<br>
		<h3><i>-IN THE PIT-</i></h3>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>So, I have to sit here and wait then. This isn't Christmas-y at all. Wait... what was that?</p>
		<br>
		<h3><i>-AT THE OASIS-</i></h3>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b><i>[jumps over the discs and puts Will on shoulder]</i> Do you know where your friends are?</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>Not really.</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b>Oh, fantastic. More Opportunity to get caught. <i>[runs off, away from the oasis]</i></p>
		<br>
		<h3><i>-DEEP IN THE JUNGLE-</i></h3>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Now that the Nurse isn't here, I would like to express how much I hate this. I hate this.</p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b><i>[lands behind Flower and reveals flame trident]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Wait, you can't attack us. I heard the Nurse say he'll blow himself up if you kill us.</p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b><i>[sighs]</i> Indeed. <i>[makes his way in the direction of the pit trap]</i> To find the child, head towards the oasis.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Where is it?</p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b>Northeast of here.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Thank you. Please kill the Nurse.</p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b>Will do.</p>
		<p><b><i>Blaze makes his way to the pit trap, which isn't to far off.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b><i>[presses some buttons]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>A trident shaped hole appears in the trap.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b><i>[stabs at Nurse]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Woah woah woah, WAIT! I've deactivated my hammer. Put down your weapons. Let's fight hand to hand.</p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b>Your preference is noted. <i>[stabs again]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>NOTED?!?</p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b><i>[stabs at Nurse repeatedly]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>A prong lands in his shoulder.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>OW! THAT'S IT! <i>[puts powercore back in hammer]</i> Try this! <i>[turns off the glowing heat of Blaze's trident]</i> Not so hot now?!</p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b>Still stabs people.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh yeah? <i>[opens the pit with hammer]</i> Now we see you!</p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b><i>[hisses]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Don't be so rude!</p>
		<p><b><i>The trident extends 3 feet</i></b></p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b><i>[stabs again]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[dodges]</i> Put it down! It makes you look weak!</p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b>I am not weak!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Then why must you use that?</p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b><i>[hisses]</i> I shall tear you apart with my bare hands! <i>[stabs pit trap controls, stopping it from closing]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Okay? Now we're talking. <i>[pulls out comically large water pistol]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>GAME SET CHECKMATE! <i>[sprays Blaze]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>The water evaporates.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh. But it was comically large!</p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b><i>[drops trident and lunges at Nurse]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Uh, this isn't good.</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b><i>[drops in from above and punches Blaze to the ground]</i> Ow ow my hand! I think I sprained something!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Now this is Christmas!</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b><i>[with Matchstick]</i> He, Nurse.</p>

		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yes, but you see my HAND FEELS LIKE IT'S ON FUCKING FIRE! Kids these days...</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b>I have some hot coals to numb the pain.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>NO MORE FUCKING FIRE!</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b>O-ok...</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Anyone have any ice?</p>
		<br>
		<h3><i>-DEEP IN THE JUNGLE-</i></h3>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>Goddamnit, where is that kid?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>No clue.</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>RHETORICAL QUESTION, DIPSHIT!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Ok, jeez. <i>[sigh]</i> Look, you're worried, I get it, but we need to stay calm to find him.</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>How would you "get it." You didn't know his first name for three years!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[breathing heavily]</i> I found you guys! Will is at the oasis!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Oh, neat.</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>Where?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>It should be close by. Over that way.</p>
		<br>
		<h3><i>-BACK WITH NURSE-</i></h3>
		<p><b><i>The three of them are running from Blaze.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Alright, gang. We ready? This maneuver may just work. Three, two, one!</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>I have disease!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>We have to stop running! Oh no!</p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b>Time to die, runt!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>The kid has disease!</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b>Y-yeah.</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b><i>[obviously fake coughing]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh no, what if we get disease!</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b>That'd be horrible.</p>
		<p><b>BLAZE: </b>What is this?</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>A very bad disease.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>NOW! <i>[uses <i>SONIC HAMMER</i> to open another pit trap under Blaze]</i> SUCKER! EXTRAPOLATE THE FANS! GRIND HIM!</p>
		<p><b><i>Giant vent fans in the pit trap wind up and suck Blaze in, grinding him into little Fire Battler chunks.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>We have to find the others!</p>
		<p><b>MATCHSTICK: </b>Holy crap, it worked!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[calmly]</i> Why wouldn't it have? <i>[strolls along]</i></p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>Where are the others.</p>
