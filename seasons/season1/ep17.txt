::IN A DESERT::
{The (RATIS) fabricates.}
Nurse: [stepping out] I may have landed us a bit right of where I was aiming for...
Flower: And by that you mean down the street? If so we can honestly just walk.
Nurse: No I mean a cosmically scaled bit.
{The camera pans out to reveal a vast and red rocky ground. As it zooms out even further we see a HUGE canyon. Then we see it. MARS!}
Nurse: Mars. We appear to be on Mars.

--{EPISODE THIRTEEN: MARS}--

Robert: Wot?
Nurse: Yeah... early days. Steerings a bit off.
Robert: My foster kids are here!
Nurse: ..
Charlotte: Mars. Cool.
Flower: You idiot.
Nurse: Well if you want we can all just go back in and... [closes and locks the doors 69 times and then tries the door] ...oh... it's locked...
Flower: Nurse.
Nurse: Yeah?
Will: Are we going to Mars still?
Nurse: We are on Mars, my dear, and very kidnapped, boy.
Will: Yay.
Robert: Not yay. We've got to get you two home!
Nurse: Just because its a space machine doesn't mean it can't travel in time!
Robert: So, now what?
Nurse: Well... It appears we have air so I guess we have no choice but to find out why.
Robert: Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrright.
Flower: Arrrright.
Charlotte: Badass, indeed.
Will: Arrrrrrrrrrrrr [lung collapses]
Nurse: [pointing off in the distance] Over there, there appears to be civilization.
Robert: Wait, was Mars always a tropical beach?
Nurse: What do you m-
{We pan out yet again to show the other side of Mars is covered in water and has tons of islands and beaches.}
Nurse: Huh. That's odd. Well my space machine does travel in time.
{A creature approaches.}
Fire Battler: Who are you?
Nurse: Oi. What year is it?
Fire Battler: Why, 1560, of course.
Nurse: You wouldn't happen to know the universal date?
Fire Battler: The what?
Nurse: Like, your date is based around your civilization's ability to catalog things. Universal is much more convenient.
Fire Battler: Oh, of course. [checks universal calendar on gun arm] 1560.
Nurse: Uh. That makes no sense.
Will: Oh my gosh, are you an alien?
Nurse: Don't be rude! You shouldn't ask questions with obvious answers.
Will: Ok.
Fire Battler: You don't seem to be from around here. Are you.......tourists?
Nurse: Only if you don't kill tourists! [winks]
Fire Battler: We don't.
Nurse: Then yes. Now can you tell me the exact date? Not just the year.
Fire Battler: Why?
Nurse: It is important. Just tell us.
Fire Battler: September 12th, 1560.
Nurse: 9/12...What Martian people are you?
Fire Battler: I am a Fire Battler.
Nurse: [fist pumps] Then this must be Christmas!
Fire Battler: Pardon?
Nurse: Holiday.
Fire Battler: Here, we celebrate (UMDRERR).
NursE: Yeah. well it's basically Christmas.
Fire Battler: This is the (UMDRERR) peninsula, so that means......follow me.
Nurse: OH! An invitation!
Flower: I don't kn-
Nurse: Shut. Christmas on Mars.
Flower: B-
Nurse: Christmas. On. MARS!!!
Will: awesome!
Nurse: I KNOW! COME ALONG, NOW!
Fire Battler: [leads them all to a big mansion]
Nurse: So what's with the ocean?
Fire Battler: What do you mean?
Nurse: Well... Mars is kind of known for... how do I put this....?
Flower: Mars doesn't have any water.
Fire Battler: Pffft! RIDICULOUS of course Mars has water. Just look over there! [points to ocean]
NursE: Wait, if the Universal date is 1560... Oh. Humans aren't even a thing yet. Ah.
Flower: You mean...
Nurse: Yeah.
Fire Battler: [visible confusion]
Nurse: I have a space machine.
Fire Battler: Y-you're a...
Nurse: (TEMPORAL RULER). Yeah. I'm the Nurse.
Fire Battler: N-nurse whom?
Nurse: Just the Nurse.
Fire Battler: Okay, then. Are the others (TEMPORAL RULERS)?
Nurse: No. Now, who wants Martian Turkey?!
Charlotte: Me.
Nurse: Do you guys have birds here?
Fire Battler: Uh n-no.
Nurse: Oh... Buecause I heard a rumor that Mars has birds that could tell time.
Flower: Nurse... don't you d-
Nurse: SHUT! CHRISTMAS ON MARS! Is that rumor anything you have heard?
Fire Battler: No, um, why?
Nurse: I was wondering if you knew the time. Do you know what time it is?
Fire Battler: No.
Nurse: KIDNAP! You need to learn how to serve a good Christmas dinner for tourists.
Fire Battler: .............................what?
Nurse: You don't have turkey.
Fire Battler: [opens door to mansion] We don't need whatever that is.
Nurse: [eyes widen]
Flower: [sees inside, too] That is overkill.
Robert: Oh my lawd! What is that?
Nurse: CHRISTMAS...(on mars).
{There is a huge flaming bird, dead on the table.}
Nurse: See! You do have birds.
Fire Battler: They're not from Mars.
Nurse: Where are they from?
Fire Battler: (ORIGOS). These Pheonixes sometimes get caught in a tear in the astral plane.
Nurse: Oh COOL!
Fire Battler: It took just about everyone on Mars to take this guy down.
Nurse: Well, Imma eat it in 3 seconds if you don't mind.
Fire Battler: NO.
Nurse: I'm only kidding. I can't even eat 1/10th of that thing.
Fire Battler: It's not for eating.
Nurse: [to other] I am going to eat it all anyways. WHAT?!
Fire Battler: My masters got the finishing blow so they get to mount its head on their wall.
Nurse: So what is for eating, then. We're hungry.
Flower: Well I-
Nurse: CHRISTMAS ON MARS. Got any Fire Battler delicacies?
Fire Battler: Uhm d-do you like [unholy screeching]? That's a classic dish.
Nurse: Oui.
Fire Battler: I'll just- [more Fire Battlers come from downstairs]
Fire Battler 2: Is Matchstick here bothering you?
Nurse: Of course!.....n o t.
Fire Battler 2: You must be here for (UMDRERR). Well my name is Lit.
Nurse: Lit.
Lit: Yes, that is me.
Nurse: And I'm saying it is lit.
Fire Battler 3: I am Blaze.
Nurse: Menacing name.
Blaze: Thank you.
Nurse: So do we do a ceremony or do we dig straight in? [to the gang] Christmas on Mars!
Charlotte: We get it.
Flower: Okay, can we head back now? We saw the Pheonix. We aren't going to eat it!
Nurse: ...
Matchstick: [comes back with plate of teeth strung together] Here you go.
Nurse: Oooh! This looks nice.
Charlotte: OH that's a thing we have to eat, heh.
Nurse: Trust me this is going to be tasty. It's a Martian Chrismas dinner!
Fire Battler 4: Yes, whatever than means. I'm Furnace. Nice to meet you.
Nurse: Furnace! Nice to meet you. So what's in this dish. Don't answer that. [takes a bite]
{The dish tastes of teeth.}
Nurse: Oh, WOW! Better than human teeth. Those are fucking disgusting.
Robert: [looks at Nurse, concerned]
Nurse: You've never had them? Lucky.
Charlotte: [shudders]
Nurse: I'm not Human. Have we not gone over this? I have a larger-exterior-than-interior-(RATIS)!
Furnace: [to Matchstick] I DO SAY, A (TEMPORAL RULER)?
Nurse: Shocked? Why thankyou!
Blaze: [claps]
Matchstick: Um, thanks.
NursE: If you want to applaud me, at least applaud yourselves for this meal.
Lit: Very well. [loud clapping]
Nurse: [claps a lot]
Flower: [stands around]
Nurse: Flower, CLAP!
Flower: [reluctantly claps]
Robert: [claps fearfully]
Charlotte: [claps confusedly]
Will: [claps because everyone else is doing it]
Matchstick: Oh, heh, wow, that hurts my ears.
Lit: So, (TEMPORAL RULER), do you want to get right into the festivities?
Nurse: HELL YEAH! Can I just  t a s t e  the bird, please?
Fire Battlers: NO.
Nurse: Swiggity Swird, coming for that BIRD! I'll get it one way or another.
Lit: Then it begins.
Matchstick: [opens door revealing a huge jungle]
Flower: Wait, jungle?
Lit: Of course.
Blaze: Ten. Nine. Eight.
Charlotte: What's going on?
Nurse: Just shut up. Seven!
Furnace: Don't you know how (UMDRERR) works?
Blaze: Seven. Six.
Nurse: Most of us are a bit new here.
Furnace: We're gonna hunt you. This is your ten second head start.
Nurse: You aren't going to (kill us) kill us right? [looks around at the gang] This is just a game?
Lit: We're gonna eat the humans, but you, (TEMPORAL RULER), will be mounted on our wall.
Nurse: Ah, well now that the Christmas cheer is all but ruined, EVERYONE INTO THE JUNGLE!
{Everyone but Nurse runs into the jungle.}
Flower: [running away] When we aren't being hunted, I will kill you!
Nurse: Now I did guarentee you one thing... [grabs Pheonix] SWIGGIDY SWIRD!!! COMING FOR THAT BIRD!!! [takes it with him into the jungle]
Blaze: Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
{The Fire Battlers prepare to chase after the gang.}
