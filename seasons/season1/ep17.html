		<h3><i>-IN A DESERT-</i></h3>
		<p><b><i>The <i>RATIS</i> fabricates.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[stepping out]</i> I may have landed us a bit right of where I was aiming for...</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>And by that you mean down the street? If so we can honestly just walk.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>No I mean a cosmically scaled bit.</p>
		<p><b><i>The camera pans out to reveal a vast and red rocky ground. As it zooms out even further we see a HUGE canyon. Then we see it. MARS!</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Mars. We appear to be on Mars.</p>

		<br>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Wot?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah... early days. Steerings a bit off.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>My foster kids are here!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>..</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>Mars. Cool.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>You idiot.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well if you want we can all just go back in and... <i>[closes and locks the doors 69 times and then tries the door]</i> ...oh... it's locked...</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Nurse.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah?</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>Are we going to Mars still?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>We are on Mars, my dear, and very kidnapped, boy.</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>Yay.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Not yay. We've got to get you two home!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Just because its a space machine doesn't mean it can't travel in time!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>So, now what?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well... It appears we have air so I guess we have no choice but to find out why.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrright.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Arrrright.</p>
		<p><b>CHARLOTTE: </b>Badass, indeed.</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>Arrrrrrrrrrrrr <i>[lung collapses]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[pointing off in the distance]</i> Over there, there appears to be civilization.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Wait, was Mars always a tropical beach?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What do you m-</p>
		<p><b><i>We pan out yet again to show the other side of Mars is covered in water and has tons of islands and beaches.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Huh. That's odd. Well my space machine does travel in time.</p>
		<p><b><i>A creature approaches.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b>Who are you?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oi. What year is it?</p>
		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b>Why, 1560, of course.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>You wouldn't happen to know the universal date?</p>
		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b>The what?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Like, your date is based around your civilization's ability to catalog things. Universal is much more convenient.</p>
		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b>Oh, of course. <i>[checks universal calendar on gun arm]</i> 1560.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Uh. That makes no sense.</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>Oh my gosh, are you an alien?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Don't be rude! You shouldn't ask questions with obvious answers.</p>
		<p><b>WILL: </b>Ok.</p>
		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b>You don't seem to be from around here. Are you.......tourists?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Only if you don't kill tourists! <i>[winks]</i></p>
		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b>We don't.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Then yes. Now can you tell me the exact date? Not just the year.</p>
		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b>Why?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>It is important. Just tell us.</p>
		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b>September 12th, 1560.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>9/12...What Martian people are you?</p>
		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b>I am a Fire Battler.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[fist pumps]</i> Then this must be Christmas!</p>
		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b>Pardon?</p>

		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well... Mars is kind of known for... how do I put this....?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Mars doesn't have any water.</p>
		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b>Pffft! RIDICULOUS of course Mars has water. Just look over there! <i>[points to ocean]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Wait, if the Universal date is 1560... Oh. Humans aren't even a thing yet. Ah.</p>

		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b>No, um, why?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I was wondering if you knew the time. Do you know what time it is?</p>
		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b>No.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>KIDNAP! You need to learn how to serve a good Christmas dinner for tourists.</p>
		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b>.............................what?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>You don't have turkey.</p>
		<p><b>FIRE BATTLER: </b><i>[opens door to mansion]</i> We don't need whatever that is.</p>

		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I'm only kidding. I can't even eat 1/10th of that thing.</p>
