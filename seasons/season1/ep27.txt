Nurse: How will we hold up against these buildings?
Flower: Don't we have shields?
Nurse: It's a type 69.
Flower: Fuck!
Jack: What? Is its weakness buildings?
Nurse: What? What does that mean?
{The Empire State building is thrown at the RATIS.}

--{EPISODE TWENTY-SEVEN: ELECTRICITY}--

Nurse: We already put a hole in it. Do we really need to destroy it?
Flower: It's America. They always rebuild.
Nurse: True. [to moth] Moth, you just YEETED the Empire State Building at me. I don't know how to react.
Lunimor: I'd Recommend dying.
Nurse: No. No, I don't think I will.
Flower: Dodge it, then.
Nurse: Ok. Now, how do you suggest we do that?
Jack: I have an idea, but it's a little completely insane.
Nurse: You're talking to the person who unraveled the Mr. Vain conspiracy.
Robert: The wot?
Nurse: He's the leader of Faligrey, but no one knows who he is. Cause he is Mr. Vain.
Jack: [opens the RATIS door] Here goes nothing...
Nurse: No, here goes your plan.
Jack: GERONIMO! [jumps out of the RATIS towards one of the Empire State Building windows] ORA! [punches window and breaks glass]
{Jack Hawk is now inside the yeeted building.}
Nurse: What the fuck does he do for exercise?
Flower: I don't know, but I have a girl boner.
Nurse: Okay? Let's just say I have one, too.
Robert: [jumps towards yeeted building]
Flower: Is everyone insane?
Nurse: [jumps]
Robert: [grabs onto the spire]
Flower: Fuck it. [leaps]
Robert: OH, GOD, WHY DID I THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IEDA?!? AAAAAAHHHHH!!!!
Nurse: Because Jack gave you a boner.
Flower: True. Robert! Grab my hand!
{The building crashes into the RATIS.}
Nurse: NO! MY (RATIS)!

Jack: [hits wall] Ow. [hits wall] Ow. [hits wall] Ow.
Nurse: I take that as a yes.
Flower: Gotcha.
Robert: Oh, wow. Not dead.
Nurse: Not yet. Jack, is the RATIS down there?
Jack: It's kinda drilling a hole in the wall.
Nurse: Get in! We're coming down. [hammers glass]
Jack: [climbs towards RATIS]
Nurse: [drops down]
{The building is nearing the ground at a high speed.}
Flower: WAIT UP! [enters the building]
Nurse: There it is! My (RATIS)! [gets in]
Flower: Yes! [enters]
Robert: [enters]
Jack: [yeets self in]
Nurser: NOW! [pulls lever] Time to fly out of here. I say we use torpedoes.
Flower: There are fucking TORPEDOES?!
Nurse: Correct. But first... [over speaker] Why do you need this electricity?
Lunimor: [surrounds time square in glowing powder] It is necessary. The livestock in my country has been all but wiped out by an awakening in the Shadowed Places from Within.
Nurse: Before I super-Murderball-Death-Kill you, I just wanted to know why. But that was lame. Extrapolate the Super-Murderball-Death-Kills!
Lunimor: You are too late. These extra terrestrials will be out new source of nourishment.
{A cocoon forms around Times Square.}
Nurse: Not after you are Super-Murderball-Death-Killed!
{The Torpedoes fire and blow up stuff. The cocoon carries Times Square into space.}
Nurse: That ain't good. My torpedoes failed.
