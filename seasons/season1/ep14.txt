::IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE::
{A flaming clown mannequin is walking towards Flower, Robert, Charlotte, and Will.}
Robert: Wonderful. It has a gun (AND) it's on fire!
Flower: Oh no. I don't think anyone ca-
Nurse: [bursts through wall] Oh! You're here! Kids, do either of you have an extraordinary sense of time?
Charlotte: What's that supposed to mean?
Nurse: I need to know if you know what time it is.
Will: It's 5:59PM.
Nurse: False! Girl, do you know what time it is?
Charlotte: Nah.
Nurse: KIDNAP!

--{EPISODE FOURTEEN: FEAR}--

Flower: What the hell is wrong with you?
Nurse: I might answer, but you will never stop asking that, anyways.
Flower: One last thing before this clown kills us, I've been asking myself this question ever since we met.
Nurse: What?
Flower: Nurse whom?
Robert: Nurse whom?
Nurse: The Nurse whom's going to save you.
Clown: [shoots firebolt that lands between Nurse and Flower]
Nurse: Yeah, should probably address that. DASH!
{They dash.}
Robert: HOW BIG IS THIS PLACE?!?
Will: Yes.
Nurse: I can't tell you, for certain, how big it is, but it may be bigger than my (RATIS). .. WAIT! COMMANDER! YOU LANDED MY (RATIS) in your disguised (TYPE 98 RATIS), did you!
Commander: [over some sort of speaker] Perhap.
Nurse: Where's the enterance-why would you tell me that. You aren't stu-
Commander: IDKLOL.
Nurse: oh. We have to find my (RATIS) and get out of here!
Will: What is a (RATIS)? Is that like a pastry?
Nurse: It could look like one, I guess... No!
Will: I'm Will, by the way. What your name?
Nurse: I'm the Nurse. Now, WIll, it is very important you answer me this. Why don't (you) like Robert?
Will: Charlotte told me he's a-I don't think I can say that out loud.
Nurse: No, please do.
Robert: Is this really necessary for our survival?
Nurse: Robert, shut. Tell me.
Charlotte: I'll explain his cuckery.
Nurse: Please do! [gets into listening position] Robert, shhhhhh....
Charlotte: Out real dad got cancer so he sent us to his brother, [gestures to Robert] who is this asswipe you see over there.
Nurse: That's it? Robert's not that bad. [to Robert] You may talk now. 
Robert: I didn't finish college so I could barely keep or find a job... I couldn't support them.
Nurse: Wait, hold on. Why are you kids here? WAIT HOLD ON! [spots a ladder] Up this ladder! This goes to the next floor! 
Flower: Can that clown even climb? It has no hands!
Nurse: Exactly!
Charlotte: But yeah, all Robert ever did was avoid paying rent and drink in the living room, sobbing like a bitch. I had to take care of Will.
Nurse: Okay, okay, I got it. Real sad. UP! NOW!! [climbs]
Flower: [follows]
{Everyone makes their way up the ladder a second later. As they reach the top, the Nurse begins to speak.}
Nurse: I may have made a huge miscalculation. [uses the (SONIC HAMMER) to light up the room]
{There, in front of them, is the Pumpkin Man, joined by 20+ plastic ghosts.}
Nurse: Huge miscalculation...
