::OUTSIDE OF A FAKE RATIS::
{Robert is shot in the leg, Flower and Nurse are both shot and passed out on the ground.}
Commander: [enters from out of a spooky lift] Game over. [to decorations] Finish the job. [leaves dramatically]
Decoration: [gets ready to shoot the Nurse in the head]

--{EPISODE SIXTEEN: THE COMMANDER ARTERYVICTORIOUS}--

Robert: NO! [stumbles and punches the decoration]
Nurse: [is woke up by the noise] I've been shot several times and need help. I have bullets in my leg and side.
Flower: [waking up] R o b e r t . . .  You did it...
Nurse: Flower's been shot worse. Let me get up by myself. [slowly gets up with a limp]
Flower: I don't know where I was shot.
Decoration: [gets back up and aims gun at Robert]
Will: You'll never see this coming! [throws a chair at the decoration]
Nurse: [limp running] EVERYONE THIS WAY! [pushes over decoration and dashes west]
Flower: Someone help me up.
Robert: [helps Flower up]
Flower: Let's go.
{Everyone follows after the Nurse.}
Clown Mannequin: [burnt, standing in front of theme]
Nurse: [bonks it with his hammer] You know, I forgot I had this to be honest. Oh. And I forgot to charge it. Whatever. Still concusses people all the same. [laughs and coughs]
Flower: Wait up!
Decorations: [follow close behind]
Charlotte: [rips the gun arm off of the clown] Badass.
Nurse: Robert! Behind you!
Decoration: [aiming gun at Robert and Flower]
Nurse: CATCH! [throws hammer to Robert]
Robert: [catches] CEASE. [bonks decoration] Mallet moment.
{The decoration sparks and falls over.}
Flower: You did it, Robert.
Nurse: Toss it back or I'll kidnap your whole family. Wait, I already did that.
Robert: [tosses back hammer]
Nurse: These are some big glorified action figures. [catches hammer] Last time I saw them, they were small, but now they're person sized.
{The Nurse has a vision of Captain Jack}
Captain Jack: [in the vision] I can't even tell you what I'm thinking right now [fades away]
Pumpkin Man: [emerges and begins to give chase followed by ghosts]
Charlotte: Uh... [fumbles with clown arm]
{The clown arm fires, shooting a ghost decoration.}
Nurse: GREAT JOB, KIDDO!
Charlotte: [guns down all of the ghosts]
Flower: Robert, what did you do to these kids to make 'em like this?
Robert: Literally nothing.
Nurse: Can you two shut? If I had known you would talk so much I wouldn't've kidnapped you!
Pumpkin man: [shoots clown arm out of Charlotte's hands]
Nurse: DASH!
{And then they all limp dashed away.}
Nurse: We need to find the (RATIS).
Flower: But the last one was fake!
Nurse: Yeah. Well I asked this before but we were interrupted. WHY THE HELL ARE YOU KIDS HERE!?!
Charlotte: Oh yeah, I rented this place for a haunted house thing. Turns out it was an alien ship.
Will: I guess that's just how it be sometimes.
Nurse: Oh, that's strange.
Robert: Ow. Ow. Are we -ow- almost there?
Nurse: I don't know we're just aimlessly dashing.
Robert: Can we dash aimfully, please? I'd prefer to keep my blood.
Nurse: Oh, yeah. Sorry. Well, we need to look through every door. On of them might be where the Commander is hiding. Like this one! [opens a door to reveal a room full of clowns, ghosts, and action figures] Shit.
Flower: Language.
Nurse: Shut up. [closes door]
Flower: How about this one! [opens a door to reveal a portapotty]
Nurse: Ah. We've found it. In here. That...thing. [opens the door]
Commander: [inside the door] Sorry, Nurse...
{The inside of the portapotty is his (TYPE 98 RATIS).}
Commander: [takes out laser hammer] OCCUPIED.
Nurse: Is that a sonic hammer?!
Commander: WHAT THE FUCK IS A SONIC!?!??!
Nurse: Okay..?
Commander: [aims laser hammer]
Nurse: Wait. Why would you want to kill me? We're friends. [winks at everyone else]
Commander: So, you'd rather me kill the humans?
Nurse: Well, when you put it that way...
Flower: Don't you dare.
Nurse: Kidding! If you're going to shoot anyone... [yoinks laser hammer] SHOOT YOUR LEPRECHAUN CIRCUIT! [shoots part of the main console.]
{The entire haunted house disappears, leaving just the portapotty.}
{From the laser hammer, a plastic arm stretches out and grab the Nurse's neck.}
Nurse: [choking] How does it do that?!
Commander: I have the Nest-In Consciousness in that hammer.
Nurse: Oh, well at least I was able to karma you first.
{The arm beings to really strangle the Nurse.}
Nurse: Ghu-
Flower: [grabs the (SONIC HAMMER) from Nurse's hand.] Nurse I got you! [bonks the arm]
Nurse: [pulls the injured arm off neck] THANKS!
Flower: No problem.
Nurse: [yeets arm and hammer across the now empty field.]
Commander: NO!
Nurse: Yes.
{The Nest-In Consciousness falls out of the compartment in the hammer. All the decorations and action figures start going crazy and shooting everywhere.}
Nest-In Consciousness: [roars]
Nurse: There's the (RATIS)! [spots it not to far off in the distance] QUICK! KIDNAP!
{The (RATIS) doors open on their own.}
Nurse: I think he finally likes me! DASH!
{Everyone dashes and makes it into the (RATIS).}
Nurse: [pauses at the door and turns back to the Commander, stretching out his hand] Come with me.
Commander: Sorry, old friend, I have my own ride. [gets in his RATIS and buggers off]
Nurse: Him and his (TYPE 98)...
Nurse: Anyways... LET'S GOOOOO!!!!!!!!
{The (RATIS) defabricates}
