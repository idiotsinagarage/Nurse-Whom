		<h3><i>-IN THE RATIS, ABOVE A COCOON COVERED TIMES SQUARE-</i></h3>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>That fucking thing is kidnapping 1999! No fair! I wanted to!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>You can't kidnap a year.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Then what is going on right now?</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>It's stealing Times Square, not the year 1999.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Wait that's New York? I thought that was 1999.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Oh boy.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What  child are you talking to?</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b><i>[latches to top of cocoon]</i></p>
		<br>
		<br>

		<h1>NURSE WHOM:</h1>
		<h1>COCOON</h1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Look!</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>The dish known as pizza is quite delectable. Especially when the ingredients are separated.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Big brain.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Big big brain.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Ooooookay then.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Now what do we do?! I mean, we have to save 1999. </p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Times FUCKING Square.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>It's 1999. Why would the button be called 1999 if it takes us to Times Square.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[kicks Nurse in the groin]</i></p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>The new cattle is on board. Sir, we will arrive in three days.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Flower, you fool, my balls are near my stomach.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[punches him in the stomach]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck FUUUUCK!</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[gets out of the RATIS and attempts to climb up the side of the cocoon, falls]</i> Damn, it's all slippery.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[puts superglue on Jack's hands]</i> not anymore.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[attempts again]</i> The liquid in the cocoon is dissolving the glue!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh no! NO! Oh... <i>[grabs magnets and puts them on his hands]</i> maybe this'll help.</p>
		<p><b><i>Jack fails as the cocoon is not made of metal.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>You idiot.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Let's try climbing the buildings.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Great idea!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Uh... Nurse, look at Robert.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>What's wrong with me?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh dear.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>What? Is it that I'm ascending towards the giant moth- AAAAAHHHHH!!!!</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b><i>[pulling Robert up with electricity]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Robert, I can't reach you!</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[running up the floors of the tallest building]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[follows]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>WAIT UP!</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>What is it?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I need to catch up! I was too busy looking at the ascending 1999.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[continues upwards]</i></p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b><i>[puts Robert on his back]</i></p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[on top of building]</i> Stop right there!</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>No.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>Let our friend go or I'll... uh..... hmmm....</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b><i>[prepares lightning antennas]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Oh no. Let's think. According to the conductivity of air, distance of conductors... <i>[think while calculation whiz]</i> ...strength of current... <i>[eyes flick back and fourth]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>What are you thinking?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well let's see... humidity... local temperatures.... <i>[pulls out dehumidifier]</i></p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[frantically dodging lightning]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>The dehumidifier begins to dehumidify the air.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Now that should reduce the conductivity of the air.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Humid air will just replace it.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>oh- <i>[cranks it to full 69 times]</i> That should do it.</p>
		<p><b><i>The air gets really dry and everyone's nose starts to bleed a little.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>What are you trying to accomplish?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Look at your electric beams! They're no more harmful than static now!</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>What? NO!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>It's my handy-dandy type 98 dehumidifier.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>So you steal a type 69 RATIS by a type 98 dehumidifier?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I told you I had a gut feeling.</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>No matter. I shall ram you!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Fuck.</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b><i>[rams]</i></p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[runs]</i></p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>OH SHI-</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b><i>[bursts through building, ripping it in half]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>DASH!</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[falling noises]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>What do you think we're doing?!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>JACK! Flower, you get Jack. I got Robert.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Okay! <i>[goes]</i></p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b>At least I'll have the weirdest death in history...</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>False.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Jack! Grab my hand!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Not a good idea.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Then what do I do?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Not that. Now, Robert, you're just going to have to sit there a minute. <i>[to Lunimor]</i> Now, I need some more answers you fucking moth retard.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>That's offensive.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>If you're afraid of offending people, then don't talk. But when you do speak, make sure it's to the right person.</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b><i>[charges at Nurse]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>And you, Lunimor, are a fucked up guy. Stealing 1999. Stop charging or I'll blow it up! <i>[pulls out hammer]</i></p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b><i>[stops]</i> How do you intend on blowing up a year?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What do you mean, year? We're on 1999 right now.</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>You are referring to Times Square.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Why the hell is everyone calling this Times Square? I press 1999, I go to FUCKING 1999!</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Yes, the YEAR 1999, which has Times Square in it, which is where we are.</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>Silence, lunch.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Don't you mean Robert Scott, the tragic loser who no one loves?</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>What do you need answers to?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Why do you need 1999?</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>After my country's livestock was killed by the Awakening, we picked up large traces of electricity here.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What awakening?</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>The elders sensed something awaken in the shadowed places from within. Something powerful, something evil, caused a rift in the astral plane.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What the fuck is an astral plane?</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>The source of all psychic energy. A manifestation of the minds of all things.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I heard there was a pheonix.</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>There were rumors of a gateway to Origos opening temporarily. </p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Origos? The FUCK si an Origos?</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>The legendary hidden planet.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>I repeat, what the FUCK is an Oreo Ghost?</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>You of all people should know, Nurse.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[still falling]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>It's a long way down. Fuck it this usually works... <i>[jumps out window]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>What was that... FLOWER! OH NO! Anyways, keep talking.</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b><i>[falling]</i> Wait what was I thinking? I'm going to die.</p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[grabs convenient flagpole]</i></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>GRAB ME!</p>
		<p><b><i>Jack grabs her out of the air.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Thank goodness.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Go on... we don't have all Times Square.</p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>Nor do I. <i>[knocks hammer out of Nurse's hand]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well, I wasn't actually going to blow up 1999 anyways, so...</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>USE THE SUPER-MURDERBALL-DEATH0KIL!!! I BROKE THE COMPRESSION FIELD ON HIS BACK-</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>But I'm not that close to the <i>RATIS</i>!</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>I am!</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Am I that loud?</p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>Louder. <i>[enters the RATIS and activates the sky torpedoes]</i></p>
		<p><b>RATIS: </b><i>[sins out of control]</i></p>
		<p><b>LUNIMOR: </b>Well shit. <i>[is super-murderball-death-killed]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>That was anticlimactic.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Let;s get 1999 back down.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Good boy, Robert.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b><i>[enters RATIS]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b><i>[enters]</i></p>
		<p><b>JACK: </b><i>[enters]</i></p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Now... 199 lowering button is right here.... <i>[slams with hammer]</i></p>
		<p><b><i>1999 is lowered.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>FLOWER: </b>We did it.</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Yeah.</p>
		<p><b>ROBERT: </b>Is anyone going to remember this?</p>
		<p><b>NURSE: </b>Well, everyone was so fucking drunk, so no. Now off we GO!</p>
