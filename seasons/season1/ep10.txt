::IN THE (RATIS)::
Robert: Now what?
Nurse: We hope we don't land in a volcano! Now then!

{The (RATIS) lands.}
NUrse: Now, let's step outside.
Robert: Okay then.
{The three of them exit.}

::ON A SPACESHIP::
Robert: [seeing window to SPPPAAAAAACE] Oh my god! Are we on a starship?
Nurse: Yeah. Now don't go walking off. Stay where I can see you.
Flower: Woah! I can see Neptune!
Nurse: That's not- whatever.
Flower: No one likes a know-it-all.
Nurse: Well, no one likes an idiot.
Flower: Well at least idiots ar-
{A door opens.}
Curtis: [groggily] Oi. Where did you come from?
Nurse: Well, we just came to stop by.
Curtis: Are you authorized to be here?
Nurse: My dear boy, are (YOU) authorized to be here?
Curtis: Yes. I'm the captain.
Nurse: [quietly] ohshit
Flower: Language.
Curtis: Hand over your badges.
Nurse: What's a badge. OH! Don't have.
Curtis: K. You're [yawns] coming with me. [pulls out gun]
Nurse: Woah!
Flower: Nurse, why the hell do you keep getting us into deadly situations?
Nurse: Well, I'm not doing it on purpose.
Robert: [puts up hands]
Nurse: Look, captain, we just came to, like, check out your ship. A goop monster, an orb monster, and rock octopus took my badge.
Flower: ...
Curtis: This is a government vessel. No badge: no entr-[sees Robert] Hold on. Are you-?
Robert: Am I what?
Curtis: You look like Robert Scott!
Nurse: I mean, he is. (Only if that's a good thing.)
Curtis: Well, he's the uncle of Will Scott, creator of Starships.
Robert: Oh, was he, um, I a foster parent to Will? -A good one?
Curtis: Obviously.
Robert: huh. [mumbles] not how I remember it...
Nurse: So yeah, we're a big deal.
Robert: Um, yes.
Curtis: [to Robert] One hell of a face lift, if I may say.
Nurse: Hey! As his dad, [to Robert] (go with this), I want you to apologize.
Robert: Y-yeah, these people are authorized.
Nurse: I'm his dad. [stares at Robert intensely]
Curtis: You look nothing like him.
Robert: HE'S AUTHORIZED, o-ok?
Flower: Yeah, me too, if anyone forgot I was here.
Curtis: Ok, so [wrist communicator buzzes] Uh, hello? Ah. Another one. You know the drill. Take 'em to sick bay. [sad sigh]
Nurse: Wait what? Is there a disease here?
Curtis: No, an infestation.
Flower: Of what? [to Nurse] We need to go.
Curtis: Wildrum.
Nurse: I pity you. I so pity you.
Flower: What are Wildrum?
Nurse: I'll tell you when you're older.
Flower: No. Tell me now.
Curtis: They live on meteors and whatever it crashes into becomes property of the Prime Wildrum. They'll kill anyone who stays in their territory and this ship just became their territory.
Nurse: How many are on this ship?
Curtis: Hundreds.
Nurse: Oh no... This is really bad. Flower, Robert; back to the (RATIS).
{Something is heard crashing through the vents. A cover is blown off.}
Nurse: Get back!
{A large green crab claw grabs the (RATIS) and pulls it into the vent.}
Nurse: NO! They've taken him!
Flower: Oh no.
